#### Key Programmes

##### M5GO Code for Fun Block-based Prototyping Programme

Secondary 1 &amp; 3 students will complete a 10-hour M5GO Code for Fun Block-Based Prototyping programme. This programme is specially designed for students with little experience in coding with microcontrollers. Using a polished M5Stack microcontroller with coloured LCD screen, this programme guides students in making prototypes which may require wireless connectivity together with a variety of components. In addition to learning about computational thinking with a fun unplugged session with Cardboard Blokies, students will learn how microcontrollers work and learn to code different electronic components. To make learning fun and relevant, students will have interactive challenges, fun mini projects, as well as a final project where they will be posed a real-world problem.

##### Coding with Drone Workshop

The Drones Programme gives students the opportunity to learn simple coding and application of their computational thinking skills to code and fly drones. Students will not only learn how to code drones on the Tynker platform using easy to learn 'drag and drop' functions, but will also get to learn how to fly drones using the Free Flight Mini app that provides ultimate control from a smartphone or tablet. Students will also get to try their hands on landing a drone on a platform and flying a drone through a simple obstacle course.
