<p>To develop students who are self-directed and passionate, a suite of programmes
has been designed for our Independent Learning Days (ILDs). This is in
line with the Ministry of Educationâ€™s initiative to provide blended learning
opportunities. Our ILDs occur once every fortnight, on even Fridays. ILD
consists of two components: 1) curriculum coverage, which we call JOY (Joy
of Learning, Ownership of Learning, Apply Learning); and 2) student-initiated
learning by the name of Project Sandbox, where students will explore non-academic
activities of their own interest.</p>
<p>This suite of programmes caters to the various levels and aims to enhance
students' digital literacy, communication, collaborative and problem-solving
skills as well as provide them with the opportunity to explore their interests
and passions. Some of these programmes are conducted synchronously in school,
while others are asynchronous, where students experience independent learning
at home and at their own pace.</p>
