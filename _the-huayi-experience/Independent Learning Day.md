To develop students who are self-directed and passionate, a suite of programmes has been designed for our Independent Learning Days (ILDs). This is in line with the Ministry of Educationâ€™s initiative to provide blended learning opportunities. Our ILDs occur once every fortnight, on even Fridays. ILD consists of two components: 1) curriculum coverage, which we call JOY (Joy of Learning, Ownership of Learning, Apply Learning); and 2) student-initiated learning by the name of Project Sandbox, where students will explore non-academic activities of their own interest.

This suite of programmes caters to the various levels and aims to enhance students' digital literacy, communication, collaborative and problem-solving skills as well as provide them with the opportunity to explore their interests and passions. Some of these programmes are conducted synchronously in school, while others are asynchronous, where students experience independent learning at home and at their own pace.

**"Through the Use of the iPad Workshop, I learned the basic uses of the iPad and how we can use the applications available. I enjoyed learning how to edit videos and appreciated the creative freedom to use the tools. I am now able to use Keynote and the tools provided to create presentations."**<br>
