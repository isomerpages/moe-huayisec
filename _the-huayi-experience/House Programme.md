The House system aims to give students an identity placed within the school, and a sense of pride in a supportive and secure environment. Hence, the House activities are designed to reflect and enhance the fulfilment of the Hua Yi student outcomes of being passionate learners, empathetic contributors, resilient leaders and glocalised citizens.  

We ‘Stepped Up’ to our first House event in 2021, which included class bonding activities held during the Secondary 1 House Immersion programme on 15 January. Students and teachers came together to enjoy a day of exciting activities that were customised for each House. Next, the school had our first House Assembly on 14 April. This day saw many students and staff ‘Step Out’ to build the tallest cup towers for Altius; react quickly in a game of Dodgeball for Citius; throw a paper plane as far as they could for Diutius; engineer strong straw bridges for Fortius; and go on a school-wide treasure hunt in the name of Latius.  

In Semester 2, during our Independent Learning Day (ILD) on 9 July, the school ‘Stepped Forward’ into an immersive House experience in the second House Assembly. Students were involved in creating a unique canvas for their respective Houses online with individual pictures. They also took part in a Kahoot! quiz which tested their knowledge of the five Houses. This second House Assembly culminated in an inter-class Zoom competition where classes clashed virtually in a classic game of Battleships.  

In the next part of the year, we look forward to our new Senior-Junior House mentorship programme where senior classes will be paired with their juniors to guide and lead them towards a meaningful end of the year as a Hua Yi family.

**"In preparation for the first House Assembly, I overcame many challenges through patience and with the help of my House Master and fellow House leaders. Overall, I felt that this dodgeball event was a success and the people from my House really enjoyed it!&nbsp;"**<br>
