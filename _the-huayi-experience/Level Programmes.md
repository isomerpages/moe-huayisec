<p>Our level programmes in Hua Yi aim to enhance learning experiences and
support holistic development through meaningful and engaging programmes.
Students in Hua Yi experience a range of activities to help them to be
future-ready leaners, equipped with the necessary skills that they need
to navigate the ever-changing landscape.</p>
<p>Secondary 1 students go through a transition programme workshop to prepare
them for secondary school life. In the process, they learn how to collaborate
and communicate with their peers and gain confidence to bravely step out
into secondary school life. The students also learn about Hua Yiâ€™s history
and unique bonsai culture during the Secondary 1 Orientation Camp.</p>
<p>Secondary 2 students embark on a journey of self-discovery with DISC profiling
and learn how to more effectively work with peers of similar and differing
personalities. Secondary 3 students go through a programme on time and
self-management to help them to better manage the demands of upper secondary
school life.</p>
<p>Finally, the Secondary 4 and 5 students prepare themselves for the year
of national examinations and post-secondary education, through the exam
skills workshops and Education and Career Guidance programmes that they
experience.</p>
