Our level programmes in Hua Yi aim to enhance learning experiences and support holistic development through meaningful and engaging programmes. True to our 2021 theme of ‘Step Up, Step Out, Step Forward’, Hua Yi students experienced a range of activities to help bring this theme to life. Through the transition programme, our Secondary 1 students bravely stepped out into secondary school life. They learnt about Hua Yi’s history and unique bonsai culture, and built bonds with their new friends in the process.

Secondary 2 students embarked on a journey of self-discovery with DISC profiling, and dabbled in Nagomi Art, a novel experience for the students indeed! Secondary 3 students stepped up, learned to take risks and also showed great teamwork with their new classmates as they constructed their magnificent domino structures.

Last but not least, the Secondary 4 and 5 students readied themselves to step forward into the post-secondary world as they created individual vision boards, had a taste of tertiary life at Nanyang Technological University and finally, fashioned impressive models made of cardboard in the Future World programme.

**"Our visit to Nanyang Technological University was an eye-opener, because it showed me potential career options that I could pursue in the future. I really enjoyed myself!"** <br>
