<img align="right" style="width:30%" src="/images/Science (1).jpg">

The aim of the Secondary School Science Curriculum is to prepare Hua Yians for life in the 21st&nbsp;century, giving them the ability to apply scientific knowledge to daily living and real-world issues.  
  
In Hua Yi, we strive to make Science lessons engaging to the students, through the incorporation of real-world examples into abstract scientific concepts, using varied methods of teaching, as well as by invoking curiosity about the natural world in students. Students play the role of the inquirer â€” one who tries to discover, while teachers lead students in the inquiry.
