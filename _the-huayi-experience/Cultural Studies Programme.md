## Cultural Studies Programme

The HY Cultural Studies Programme aims to nurture Hua Yians into passionate learners, empathetic contributors, resilient leaders and glocalised citizens through a strong foundation in understanding and appreciating the intricacies of various languages, cultures and perspectives of Southeast Asian countries.

This is achieved through appreciating school culture, gaining a deeper understanding of local culture, as well as developing global perspectives. The programme also encourages the development of outward-looking mindsets, and the understanding and appreciation of different cultures and perspectives through the design of inbound and outbound programmes. The programme also seeks to enable Hua Yians to contribute and make a difference on a wider scale by allowing students to take charge in coordinating visits to Hua Yi, as well as plan and conduct research on various cultures for outbound trips.
