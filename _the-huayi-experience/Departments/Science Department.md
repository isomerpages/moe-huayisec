<p>The aim of the Secondary School Science Curriculum is to prepare Hua Yians
for life in the 21st&nbsp;century, giving them the ability to apply scientific
knowledge to daily living and real-world issues.</p>
<p>In Hua Yi, we strive to make Science lessons engaging to the students,
through the incorporation of real-world examples into abstract scientific
concepts, using varied methods of teaching, as well as by invoking curiosity
about the natural world in students. Students play the role of the inquirer
â€” one who tries to discover, while teachers lead students in the inquiry.</p>
