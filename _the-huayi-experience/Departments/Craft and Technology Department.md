<h5>Learning Journey to Art Museums</h5>

experience that cultivates their art appreciation. Due to safe management
measures, the department is exploring a virtual museum experience for our
students. For talent development, the Art unit is offering Secondary 3
Art students with very strong drawing and rendering skills the choice to
do Higher Art in Secondary 4.</p>

3 NFS students apply their knowledge on keeping a healthy diet in real-world
contexts, through taking part in activities like the 14-day No Sugared
