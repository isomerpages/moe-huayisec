#### Key Programmes

##### Learning Journey to Art Museums

Secondary 1 students get to visit an art museum each year, an invaluable experience that cultivates their art appreciation. Due to safe management measures, the department is exploring a virtual museum experience for our students. For talent development, the Art unit is offering Secondary 3 Art students with very strong drawing and rendering skills the choice to do Higher Art in Secondary 4.

##### D&amp;T Skills Enrichment Programme

The D&amp;T unit seeks to develop students who demonstrate talent and passion in the subject. Students get the opportunity to learn metal lathe work, wood lathe work and milling directly from our Technical Support Officers.

##### Promoting Healthy Lifestyle

The NFS unit promotes a healthy lifestyle through their curriculum. Secondary 3 NFS students apply their knowledge on keeping a healthy diet in real-world contexts, through taking part in activities like the 14-day No Sugared Drink Challenge.
