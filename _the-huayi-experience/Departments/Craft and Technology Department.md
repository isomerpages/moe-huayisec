Through Making Thinking Visible with Drawing, students learn to express
ideas and make their thinking processes visible, developing both technical
and conceptual skills.</p>
<h4>1.1 Learning with Portfolios</h4>
<p>Lower Secondary students begin their artistic journey with e-portfolios,
which help them track progress, record artworks, and document processes.
These e-portfolios extend to Upper Secondary, preparing students for tertiary
Early Admission Programmes (EAE) and serving as a valuable showcase of
their growth and unique artistic voice.</p>
<h4>1.2 Talent Development</h4>

our Art Unit offers an advanced Higher Art option in Secondary 4, supporting

<h4>2. Design &amp; Technology</h4>
<p>The D&amp;T curriculum provides students with a design and make programme
which allows them to solve real-world problems. Students use the Design
Process (similar to Design Thinking) in their problems solving approach.
The curriculum develops students' creative, innovative and adaptive thinking.
It also aims to build students' resilence and self-confidence. At lower
secondary, students are given design situations to scaffold their learning.
They design and make handphone holders, night lights, and desk tidies.
At upper secondary, students will choose their own design situations before
embarking on their design and make journey.</p>
