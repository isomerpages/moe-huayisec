<h4>Key Programmes</h4>
<h4>1. ART</h4>
<p>Our Art Programme fosters creativity, critical thinking, and self-expression
through meaningful artmaking and inquiry. By engaging students in activities
involving “Drawing to See” to “Think”, and to “Imagine”, students develop
keen observation, imagination, and visual reasoning skills that make their
thinking visible through art.</p>
<p>Learning with Portfolios and Visual literacy:</p>
<p>From Lower Secondary, students embark on their artistic journey through
e-portfolios, where they document their learning, creative processes, and
reflections. This practice encourages visual analysis and visual exploration,
helping students understand how ideas take form through making and reflection.</p>
<p>As they progress to Upper Secondary, students continue to build on their
portfolios as a showcase of their artistic growth and unique voice. This
process supports the development of critical, adaptive, and inventive thinking
— core outcomes of the new Art syllabus — and prepares them to curate and
present their artworks with confidence and purpose.</p>
<p>Through these experiences, our Art Programme equips students to be reflective,
creative, and future-ready learners, capable of responding thoughtfully
to the world through visual expression.</p>

<h4>2. Design &amp; Technology</h4>
<p>The D&amp;T curriculum provides students with a design-and-make programme
which allows them to solve real-world problems. Students use the Design
Process (similar to Design Thinking) in their problems solving approach.
The curriculum develops students' creative, innovative and adaptive thinking.
It also aims to build students' resilience and self-confidence. At lower
secondary, students are given design situations to scaffold their learning.
They design and make handphone holders, night lights, and desk tidies using
resistant materials like wood, metal and plastic. At upper secondary, students
will choose their own design situations before embarking on their design-and-make
journeys.</p>
