<h5>Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) Programme (Level Wide Programme: Secondary 1) and the Cultural Learning Carnival</h5>
<p>The Conversational Chinese/Malay (CCM) Programme is introduced as an enrichment
programme for our Secondary 1 students to learn more about the Chinese/Malay
language and culture. It also promotes cross-cultural learning and at the
same time, aims to encourage students to acquire a third language that
they can converse in comfortably. This CCM Programme culminates in the

joy in language learning. At the end of the programme, students should
