##### Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) Programme (Level Wide Programme: Secondary 1) and the Cultural Learning Carnival

The Conversational Chinese/Malay (CCM) Programme is introduced as an enrichment programme for our Secondary 1 students to learn more about the Chinese/Malay language and culture. It also promotes cross-cultural learning and at the same time, aims to encourage students to acquire a third language that they can converse in comfortably. This CCM Programme culminates in the Cultural Learning Carnival where students will not only apply but also extend their learning beyond mastering the language in classrooms and experience joy in language learning. At the end of the programme, students should be able to minimally communicate (listen and speak) on everyday situations using the language.

The Malay Language Cultural Fortnight was held during the Learning Festival to inspire a love for the Malay Language via authentic learning experiences and foster a more conducive learning environment for students to use the Malay language. This programme aims to ignite students’ interest in using the language and inculcate the right culture and values through engaging, innovative and appealing ways. Some activities conducted were the Making of Bunga Rampai and the Making of Bunga Telur and Wayang Kulit.
