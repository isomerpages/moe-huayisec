<h4>Key Programmes</h4>
<h5>M5GO Code for Fun Block-based Prototyping Programme</h5>
<p>Secondary 1 &amp; 3 students will complete a 10-hour M5GO Code for Fun
Block-Based Prototyping programme. This programme is specially designed
for students with little experience in coding with microcontrollers. Using
a polished M5Stack microcontroller with coloured LCD screen, this programme
guides students in making prototypes which may require wireless connectivity
together with a variety of components. In addition to learning about computational
thinking with a fun unplugged session with Cardboard Blokies, students
will learn how microcontrollers work and learn to code different electronic
components. To make learning fun and relevant, students will have interactive
challenges, fun mini projects, as well as a final project where they will
be posed a real-world problem.</p>
<h5>Coding with Drone Workshop</h5>
<p>The Drones Programme gives students the opportunity to learn simple coding
and application of their computational thinking skills to code and fly
drones. Students will not only learn how to code drones on the Tynker platform
using easy to learn 'drag and drop' functions, but will also get to learn
how to fly drones using the Free Flight Mini app that provides ultimate
control from a smartphone or tablet. Students will also get to try their
hands on landing a drone on a platform and flying a drone through a simple
obstacle course.</p>
