#### Key Programmes

##### Geographical Investigation

At the Lower Secondary level, students are provided with various authentic learning experiences to sharpen their awareness of environmental and social issues. For example, in Secondary 1, students investigate the impact of human activities on waterways in Singapore at Jurong Eco Garden (2018-2019) and Jurong Lake (2020) through onsite testing and evaluation of water samples collected. Such experiential learning also happens at the Upper Secondary level, for example with field studies conducted as part of Secondary 4 Elective Geography. Virtual Reality is also used as a pre-fieldwork orientation tool for our students. The VR experience helps students to familiarise themselves with the fieldwork site, providing an exciting complementary source of information for the students.

##### Historical Investigation

As inquiry is crucial in History teaching, every student will have to participate in a Historical Investigation (HI) to reconstruct knowledge about a period of time. This approach enables students to inquire into history through the gathering of sources. With the sources of information, they exercise historical reasoning to turn these sources into evidence and finally engage in reflective thinking to make sound, well-supported interpretations. In engaging students in HI, they will develop into self-directed, critical and reflective thinkers. Through this process of inquiry, they will also learn to work collaboratively with others.

##### Issues Investigations

In Social Studies Issues Investigations, our Secondary 3E and NA students were engaged in a project where they were required to explore a societal issue together, glean the multiple perspectives of interviewees and present their solutions using Piktocharts. Working collaboratively with their peers, our students were given the opportunity to develop their critical thinking skills and deepen their learning as they pause and reflect on their understanding of the issue of Diversity and how it relates to their everyday experiences in school. This project further strengthens their civic literacy as students learn to respect differences of others and propose recommendations to facilitate integration in Singapore society.

##### NUS National Geography Challenge

Geography students are given opportunities to participate in competitions such as the annual NUS Geography Challenge. The experience and interactions with other participants provide deeper insights into various geographical issues and allow them to take a broader perspective on global issues. Four of our students participated in the NUS Geography Challenge 2020, submitting a poster on the theme of ‘Sustainability’ as well as taking part in a quiz. Two participants attained the bronze award for the bronze component. The resilience and creativity they demonstrated during this competition has done the school proud.

##### Money &amp; Me

As part of our school’s Learning Festival 2019, the Social Studies Unit collaborated with the POA Unit to co-create an opportunity for outdoor learning to engage our students. With an inter-disciplinary approach in mind, our Secondary 3 students attended a financial literacy talk where they learned about the importance of personal savings and budget and explored the National Budget 2019 further through a variety of challenges. Tapping on their existing Issues Investigation groupings, our students worked together in games, ranging from crossword puzzles to memory games in order to get clues to complete 6 stations — Amazing Race style. This learning opportunity prepares our students to be future-ready by providing them with an ideal platform to develop their awareness on financial literacy and national policies. In Hua Yi, we strive to make the learning of Humanities subjects come alive.

##### Humanities Youth Leaders and ECG Programme

Our Upper Secondary Humanities students have the opportunity to participate in the Humanities Youth Leaders and ECG Programme. Through participating in online forums, students get the opportunity to interact with guest speakers who provide deep insights to the skills set important for the 21st century employment landscape. Workshops are also conducted to enhance students’ proficiency in technological applications and skills (such as ArcGIS and curation of VR videos) which allow them to appreciate the real-world applications of the Humanities.
