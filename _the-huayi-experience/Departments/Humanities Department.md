<h4>Key Programmes</h4>
<h5>Social Studies Issues Investigations</h5>
<p>In Social Studies Issues Investigations, our Sec 3G3 and G2 students collaboratively
explore pressing societal issues, such as Singapore's plastic waste management.
By researching various stakeholders and utilising e-pedagogical tools,
students develop their critical thinking skills while deepening their understanding
of civic responsibilities. This project not only cultivates respect for
diverse perspectives but also empowers students to propose collaborative
solutions involving both government and non-government bodies.</p>
<p>Through engaging discussions and initiatives like Issues Investigations,
we nurture informed and concerned citizens with a global perspective, ready
to contribute thoughtfully to society.</p>
<h5>Historical Investigation</h5>
<p>Every student will be introduced to the Inquiry-based approach and get
to participate in a Historical Investigation (HI) project to reconstruct
knowledge and answer an important question about the past. This approach
enables students to inquire into history through the gathering of sources.
With the sources of information, they exercise historical reasoning to
turn these sources into evidence and finally engage in reflective thinking
to make sound and well-supported interpretations. By engaging students
in HI, they will develop into self-directed, critical and reflective thinkers.
Through this process of inquiry, they will also learn to work collaboratively
with others. Students will also learn how to conduct research using various
National Library Board resource repositories such as Infopedia and NewspaperSG,
or play historical board games, in order to experience the significance
of past events and how historical evidence is used to reconstruct an understanding
of the past.</p>
<h5>Geographical Inquiry through Fieldwork</h5>
<p>At the Lower Secondary level, students engage in various authentic learning
experiences to enhance their awareness of environmental and social issues.
For example, in studying water issues, Secondary 1 students investigate
the impact of human activities on Singapore's waterways through on-site
testing and evaluation of water samples collected at Jurong Lake. To deepen
their understanding of ecosystems, students also embark on investigative
journeys documenting their interactions with flora and fauna within the
school compound. In Secondary 2, students explore the relevance of Geography
in their everyday lives through investigative studies conducted at transport
hubs (e.g. Jurong East Interchange).</p>
<p>Such experiential learning continues at the Upper Secondary level with
field studies conducted as part of the Geography curriculum at Kampong
Glam (Tourism Studies), Choa Chu Kang Transport Hub (Everyday Geography),
and Science Centre Earth Alive! (Tectonic Studies).</p>
<p>In Geography education within the school, eco-stewardship is emphasised
as an essential value. Lessons incorporate decision-making scenarios where
students evaluate environmental policies or analyse the pros and cons of
land-use practices. Through these exercises, students learn to weigh environmental,
economic, and social factors, reinforcing their role as eco-stewards.</p>
<h5>MOE-NUS Geography Challenge</h5>
<p>Geography students are given opportunities to participate in competitions
such as the annual NUS Geography Challenge. Through the competition, the
participants were given the opportunity to explore the topic of sustainability
and Singapore Green Plan 2030 using a geographical lens. Also, through
gamification, the participants gained insights to the idea of trade-offs,
as well as learned how global issues of sustainability can be understood
in a fun and interesting way.</p>
<h5>History Competitions</h5>
<p>Our Secondary Two students take part in the Historical Scene Investigation
and Prove It! Contest, both organised by the National Library Board and
supported by the Ministry of Education. In both inter-school competitions,
our students put their historical inquiry and research skills to the test,
researching on topics such as past pandemics or the significance of events
that happened in Singapore after the Second World War. Students will present
their findings through creative end products such as animations, videos,
posters, or even as a skit. They also get the opportunity to hone their
public speaking skills by presenting their findings to their schoolmates
during morning assembly. In 2024, our students clinched the Gold Award
(Top 10 Teams) in the Prove It! Contest and two teams earned the Silver
Award in the Historical Scene Investigation.</p>
<h5>Humanities Youth Leaders and ECG Programme</h5>
<p>Our Upper Secondary Humanities students have the opportunity to participate
in the Humanities Youth Leaders and ECG Programme. Through participating
in online forums, students get the opportunity to interact with guest speakers
who provide deep insights to the skills set important for the 21st century
employment landscape. Workshops are also conducted to enhance studentsâ€™
proficiency in technological applications and skills, and students also
go on learning journeys which allow them to appreciate the real-world applications
of the Humanities.</p>
<h5>NJC International Humanities Symposium (IHS) (Social Studies)</h5>
<p>Our Upper Secondary Humanities students actively participate in the NJC
International Humanities Symposium (IHS), a platform that showcases their
research on vital global issues. This initiative explicitly aligns with
e21CC principles, fostering civic, global, and cross-cultural competencies.
By exploring themes such as resource depletion and social inequality, our
students engage in critical discussions that enhance their understanding
of civic responsibility and global interconnectedness. The symposium encourages
collaboration with peers from diverse backgrounds, promoting cross-cultural
understanding and respect. Through their involvement in the IHS, students
develop innovative solutions for a sustainable future, empowering them
to become informed and proactive citizens ready to effect positive change
in their communities and beyond.</p>
