<h4>Key Programmes</h4>
<h5>G1 Humanities: Exploring Our World and Society </h5>
<p>At the G1 level, students are introduced to the Humanities through exposure
modules in Geography, History and Literature, apart from Social Studies.
These modules help students explore how people interact with their environment,
understand significant events and issues that shape societies, and appreciate
how stories and texts reflect human experiences and emotions.</p>
<p>Learning in Humanities goes beyond the coursebooks— students engage in
hands-on activities, discussions, and digital learning experiences that
bring the subjects to life. Through these experiences, they develop essential
21st-century skills such as critical thinking, empathy, communication,
and responsible citizenship, nurturing curious minds ready to understand
and contribute to the world around them.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>Social Studies Issues Investigations </h5>
<p>In Social Studies, our Secondary 3 students take on real-world sustainability
issues through the Issues Investigation project. Expanding beyond past
topics like plastic waste management, this year’s students explored areas
such as energy, water, health and wellbeing, and sustainable urban living.</p>
<p>Through research, stakeholder analysis, and the use of digital tools,
students learned to think critically, appreciate diverse perspectives,
and propose practical solutions for a more sustainable Singapore. These
experiences nurture informed and responsible citizens who are ready to
contribute meaningfully to society.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>History Learning Experiences </h5>
<p>At the Lower Secondary level, History learning nurtures curiosity and
critical thinking through inquiry-based and experiential experiences that
make the study of the past relevant to students’ lives today. Lessons are
designed to help students explore historical perspectives, analyse evidence,
and reflect on how Singapore’s past shapes its identity and values.</p>
<p>In Secondary One, students use educational technology tools such as Gemini
to explore life in Singapore in the 1300s. By posing questions, analysing
findings, and discussing interpretations, they develop inquiry skills and
deepen their appreciation of Singapore’s early history in an engaging and
interactive way.</p>
<p>In Secondary Two, game-based pedagogy brings historical learning to life
through an in-house designed board game that simulates the political tensions
of post-war Singapore. Through card mechanics and decision-making tasks,
students experience the trade-offs and dilemmas faced by different factions
— the British, Communists, and Non-Communists — cultivating historical
empathy and understanding of the complexities in Singapore’s road to independence.</p>
<p>Students undertake Historical Investigations (HI) to examine key questions
about the past, evaluate sources, and construct evidence-based interpretations.
As part of their investigations, students engage with authentic historical
materials using National Library Board resource repositories such as Infopedia
and NewspaperSG, as well as the National Archives’ Oral History Interviews
collection. These experiences allow them to apply inquiry skills to real-world
sources and deepen their appreciation of how evidence is used to reconstruct
the past.</p>
<p>Ultimately, History education in Hua Yi serves as a platform for developing
civic, global, and cross-cultural literacy, enabling students to make sense
of the world around them and contribute thoughtfully as informed citizens
in a diverse society.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>Geography Learning Experiences: Cultivating Inquiry and Eco-Stewardship</h5>
<p>At the Lower Secondary level, Geography learning is designed to nurture
students’ curiosity and deepen their understanding of real-world environmental
and social issues. Through inquiry-based and authentic learning experiences,
students explore the dynamic relationships between people and the environment.</p>
<p>In Secondary 1, students participate in outdoor geographical investigations
that develop their spatial awareness and encourage reflection on sustainable
actions in their daily lives. In Secondary 2, collaborative research projects
on housing and transport issues strengthen students’ inquiry, critical
thinking, and teamwork skills as they analyse patterns, propose solutions,
and appreciate diverse perspectives on sustainable living.</p>
<p>The experiential learning approach continues at the Upper Secondary level,
where field studies are conducted as part of the Geography curriculum at
key sites such as Choa Chu Kang Transport Hub (Insights into Urban Planning),
Bird Paradise (Tourism Studies), and the Science Centre’s Earth Alive!
exhibition (Tectonic Studies).</p>
<p>Across all levels, eco-stewardship is emphasised as a core value in Geography
education. Lessons incorporate decision-making scenarios that challenge
students to evaluate environmental policies and analyse the trade-offs
involved in addressing current geographical issues. Through these exercises,
students learn to weigh environmental, economic, and social factors in
decision-making — reinforcing their role as responsible and informed eco-stewards.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>MOE-NUS Geography Challenge </h5>
<p>Geography students are given opportunities to participate in national
competitions such as the annual NUS Geography Challenge (GC), organised
by the National University of Singapore’s Department of Geography. As part
of their preparation, students undergo school-based training sessions that
strengthen their geographical concepts, sharpen their analytical skills,
and build confidence in applying inquiry-based thinking to current issues.</p>
<p>Through this competition, students explore themes such as sustainability
and the Singapore Green Plan 2030 using a geographical lens. They also
engage in gamified learning experiences that help them understand trade-offs
and global sustainability challenges in a fun and meaningful way, while
developing critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaborative skills
alongside peers from other schools.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>History Competitions</h5>
<p>Our Secondary Two students take part in the Historical Scene Investigation
and Prove It! contests, both organised by the National Library Board and
supported by the Ministry of Education. In these inter-school competitions,
students apply their historical inquiry and research skills to investigate
topics such as past pandemics or the significance of events that shaped
Singapore after the Second World War. They present their findings through
creative end products such as animations, videos, posters, or skits, and
hone their public speaking skills by sharing their work with peers during
morning assembly.</p>
<p>In the Historical Scene Investigation, our students achieved two Silver
Awards in 2024 and went on to earn one Gold and one Silver Team Award in
2025. In the Prove It! contest, our students clinched the Gold Award (Top
10 Teams) in 2024 and followed up with two Silver Awards in 2025, which
is a testament to our students’ consistency and growing expertise in historical
inquiry.</p>
<p>Our Secondary Three students also participated in the annual War &amp;
Diplomacy Challenge hosted by Bendemeer Secondary School, a strategy card
game of survival and conquest that simulates the experience of governments
during the turbulent era of 1918–1945. The game challenges students to
make political decisions related to invasion, trade, diplomacy, reparations,
sanctions, propaganda, and appeasement. Closely aligned with the Upper
Secondary History syllabus, the competition brings historical concepts
to life and deepens students’ engagement with the subject. In 2025, our
school won the 1st Runner-Up Team Award, with seven students reaching the
semi-finals and one finalist in the competition.</p>
<p>The MOE History Challenge also engages our Secondary Three students in
the disciplinary thinking of History. Through this quiz-based competition,
they demonstrate their historical knowledge and apply conceptual understanding
across different historical periods. The experience strengthens their mastery
of key historical concepts while developing confidence in articulating
evidence-based arguments.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>Voices of Humanities</h5>
<p>Voices of Humanities (VOH) offers students authentic opportunities to
connect classroom learning with the real world. In 2025, students explored
themes such as the Green Economy, AI and Digital Business, and Sustainability,
deepening their understanding of how the Humanities relate to Singapore’s
future.</p>
<p>Through factory visits, entrepreneurship workshops, digital marketing
projects with real startups, eSports broadcasting, and photography competitions,
students learned to think critically, communicate confidently, and appreciate
diverse perspectives.</p>
