<h4>Key Programmes</h4>
<h5>Language Festival</h5>
<p>Words have meaning and power. Lang Fest celebrates the beauty of the written
word, the diversity of literary genres and the love of reading. Exciting
activities to inspire students to read and write include book talks, ‘Books
2 Go’ mass borrowing and learning to write a haiku. The English Department’s
signature CharacteRISE Day is also held to breathe life into characters
portrayed in fiction, where staff and students turn up at school all donned
in costumes of their favourite fictional characters.</p>
<h5>Library Programme</h5>
<p>The English Department’s Library Programme provides students with opportunities
to experience joy in learning vocabulary and exercising thinking skills
through competitive word games. Secondary 1 students participate in library
orientation activities, Anagram Scramble and Spelling Bee, while Secondary
2 students engage in the game, Bananagram. Other school-wide activities
include Blind Date with a Book, Golden Ticket, scavenger hunts and thematic
book displays.</p>
<h5>DEAR Programme</h5>
<p>Our Drop Everything And Read (DEAR) programme is a school-wide reading
programme which aims to nurture a love of reading in students whilst developing
their general knowledge and global perspectives. Students read critically
and with accuracy, understanding and appreciation a wide array of literary
and informational genres of their choice, such as short stories, novels,
educational magazines, articles curated by teachers and even their schoolmates’
published works, from various print to non-print digital sources via students’
iPads. The DEAR programme also includes Book Buzz, a platform for students
to share and recommend books to their friends.</p>
<h5>DEAL Programme</h5>
<p>Our Drop Everything And Listen (DEAL) Programme is a five-minute broadcast
of audio and video clips which are purposefully curated by teachers to
broaden students’ glocalised perspectives, develop listening skills as
well as enhance vocabulary uptake. Synopses, lead-in questions and content-specific
vocabulary are displayed while the audio-visual clips are played. Class
discussions and debates are held to extend learning. The DEAL Programme
was awarded the Best Suggestion of the Year (HQ) in 2014, in recognition
of the outstanding and innovative work done by teachers.</p>
<h5>Public Speaking</h5>
<p>Let oracy be the key. The English Department makes concerted efforts in
developing students into eloquent, effective and empathetic communicators.
We strive to foster a community for young public speakers to challenge
themselves and bring their public speaking skills to the next level by
providing students with opportunities to present their thoughts and views
to others, selecting good students and cultivating them to be better at
their craft, as well as developing their confidence in public speaking
through representing the school in national competitions such as the PESA,
YMCA Public Speaking Competition, ACJC Orator’s Trophy and ACJC Speech
Arts Competition.</p>
<h5>It’s LIT!</h5>
<p>Experiencing Literature in Hua Yi is akin to holding up a clear mirror
to understand yourself and your role in relation to the world around you,
through the written word. Through the imaginative worlds of famous authors,
playwrights and poets, students gain multiple perspectives, practise open-mindedness
and develop a keen eye for critical analysis. In Hua Yi, Literature students
represent the school in national competitions such as the Singapore Youth
Critic Competition and National Schools Literature Festival, and have opportunities
to hone their literary talents by participating in many invigorating workshops
such as the Unity Writers’ Festival and the JWSS Literature Symposium.</p>
