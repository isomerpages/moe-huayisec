<h4>Key Programmes</h4>
<h5>E-Learning Portal</h5>
<p>The portal provides a platform for students to do independent learning
beyond the classroom. Teachers also leverage the comprehensive online resources
and animations to value-add to the studentsâ€™ learning of Mathematics.</p>
<h5>Maths Trail/Mathematical Modelling Activities/Performance Tasks</h5>
<p>The Maths Trails, Mathematical Modelling Activities and Performance Tasks
are organised to raise the engagement of students in learning Mathematics
and view the world around them from a mathematical perspective.</p>
<h5>Mathematic s Competitions (SMO, SMKC, IMMC)</h5>
<p>Students with a keen interest and aptitude in mathematics can take part
in math competitions, further sharpening their problem-solving abilities.
The program offers a series of structured training sessions to help students
prepare for these competitions.</p>
<h5>Bridging Programmes</h5>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Foundation Mathematics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structured Remedial/Consultation Sessions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject-Based Bridging</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students are given the opportunity to study higher stream Mathematics
and are coached by their teachers beyond the curriculum. For the students
who need additional support in Mathematics, they are also given extra coaching
after curriculum hours to help them bridge the gap.</p>
<h5>Peer-Tutoring Programme</h5>
<p>The seniors are given the opportunity to coach their juniors in this programme.
This programme promotes self-directed learning and fosters a culture of
care in the students. The students are able to review their basic fundamentals
and use the opportunity to hone their communication skills while interacting
with others.</p>
