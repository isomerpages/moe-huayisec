<h2>Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</h2>
<p>Hua Yi’s Applied Learning Programme is a distinctive programme that embraces
Design Thinking and an interdisciplinary approach, integrating various
subjects such as English, Design &amp; Technology, ICT, Science, and Character
and Citizenship Education.</p>
<p><strong>Our Aim is to</strong>
</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equip students with the skills to
navigate the complexities and challenges of the digital age, addressing
social and economic changes and fostering innovation.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Empower students with the confidence
to solve real-world problems through technology and design thinking, enabling
them to become creators, communicators, and contributors.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop Emerging 21st Century and
Socio-emotional Competencies such as problem-solving, interpersonal communication,
and situational analysis.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encourage lifelong learning and
adaptability through positive educational experiences.</p>

<p>In ALP in Hua Yi aims to equip students with the skills and mindset needed
to thrive in a rapidly evolving digital world. It fosters confidence in
problem-solving, promotes lifelong learning, and applies STEM concepts
through a Design Thinking approach. Additionally, it develops essential
21st Century Competencies and Social-Emotional skills such as critical
thinking, communication, and situational awareness. The programme is tiered
at three levels as shown in the diagram above.</p>
<p>Secondary 1 students now use Micro:bit kits (transitioning from M5GO)
to learn block-based coding and computational thinking. The programme emphasizes
hands-on learning through guided projects and design thinking, laying a
strong foundation in digital literacy.</p>

<p>Secondary 2 students progress to the AI for Fun module, where they explore
artificial intelligence concepts using hardware like the AI EF Kit and
ET Kit 2. They apply prior knowledge to build smart solutions, deepening
their understanding of AI, ethics, and real-world applications. Both levels
are fully funded by IMDA and MOE, supporting holistic &nbsp;digital education.
This year, in collaboration with the&nbsp;VIA Committee, Sec 2 students
designed and produced&nbsp;keychains for senior citizens&nbsp;as part of
their&nbsp;Class-based VIA projects, applying tech skills to serve the
community. These experiences nurture&nbsp;21st Century Competencies (21CC)&nbsp;such
as empathy and innovation, and reflect the school’s theme of&nbsp;“Voices
that Care.”</p>
<p>Secondary 3 students benefited from participating in the Applied Learning
Programme (ApLM), a key initiative by polytechnics and ITEs. These courses,
primarily STEM-related, aim to expose students to practical, real-world
applications of their learning. ApLM helps students discover interests,
develop competencies beyond the classroom, and explore future education
and career pathways.</p>
<h4>Overseas Trip to Taiwan</h4>

</div>
<p>A group of students recently completed a highly successful overseas trip
to Taiwan for an exciting exchange program centered on STEM activities.
The delegation visited Longshan Junior High School in Taipei, where they
engaged in collaborative projects with their Taiwanese peers, fostering
a spirit of cross-cultural learning.</p>
<p>A major highlight was the visit to the Sha Yang Robot Wonderland, where
the students got hands-on experience building their very own solar-powered
robots. They also explored the Science Museum, deepening their understanding
of various scientific principles. Throughout the exchange, the students
made new friends from Taiwan, successfully exchanging ideas and collaborating
on STEM projects focused on the design and building of innovative bridges.</p>
<h4>Students’ Quote:</h4>
<p><em>Learning to operate the M5GO and the M5Flow website was certainly an eye-opener for me since I am not familiar with coding. Coding was much more complex than I thought, considering the range of functions that are available on the website. This includes the speaker, the LED light, along with many other cool things like the servo motor and the motion detecting device. The thing about the website that intrigued me the most was that I could make my M5GO play any piece of music. The most fulfilling part of ALP is being able to hone my leadership skills during the group work. I took the initiative to step up as the leader for the later part of the project and it tested my abilities to delegate and organize tasks, communicate with group members and coordinate with one another to complete our presentation slides.</em>

<p>Hua Yi’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – Technology for Active Living
– is a distinctive programme that embraces Design Thinking and an interdisciplinary
approach, integrating various subjects such as English, Design &amp; Technology,
ICT, Science, and Character and Citizenship Education . This programme
aims to equip students with the skills and mindset needed to navigate the
complexities and challenges of the digital age, marked by rapid social
and economic transformation. It seeks to inspire lifelong learning, fostering
creative confidence in students to generate innovative solutions to real-world
problems.</p>
<p>Hua Yians participate in Tier 1 cohort-wide programmes like programming
lessons using M5GO which is in collaboration with iMDA and the Tier 2 Interest
Area Programmes such as STEM-related competitions and applied learning
at the ITEs and Polytechnics. The ALP Committee also provides students
with industrial attachment opportunities through its Tier 3 programmes.</p>
<p>This year, Hua Yi introduced Makerspace workshops where students can engage
in design and maker activities in areas of their interest. In Semester
1, students expanded their learning by engaging in block programming to
design aerial drone shows. The workshop was both enjoyable and beneficial,
offering students valuable hands-on experience.</p>
<p>Aligned with this year's school theme, 'Passing It On!', the committee,
in collaboration with Dunman Secondary School and North East CDC, organized
two Values In Action (VIA) maker activities for different age groups. The
Student Tech Champions led a workshop for children aged 4-6, guiding them
in designing and decorating their own BoomBox. The Art Club hosted a second
activity, working with senior citizens to create and design hats and fans.
All products were made using recyclable materials, fostering creativity
and sustainability throughout the projects.</p>
<p><em>ALP has broadened my understanding of the basics of coding. It’s fun to experiment with the M5GO and other small gadgets, and I’ve learned so much more about them. My group created a push-up sensor, and it was exciting to do the coding, build the base, and celebrate when we finally completed the task.</em>

<p><em>The ALP lessons were fun and engaging, as learning coding was a new and enjoyable experience. The trainers were especially helpful during lessons, offering support when we had questions or faced challenges. If given the chance, I would love to attend more ALP lessons.</em>

<p><em>ALP allows me to learn more about technology and gives me the opportunity to bond with my friends as we work together in a team. Despite the limited time during these lessons, they still encourage me to think creatively, and I find them very enjoyable. It was an excellent experience that pushed me out of my comfort zone and allowed me to try something new.</em>
