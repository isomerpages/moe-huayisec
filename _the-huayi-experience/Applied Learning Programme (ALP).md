<p>Hua Yi’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – Technology for Active Living
– is a distinctive programme that embraces Design Thinking and an interdisciplinary
approach, integrating various subjects such as English, Design &amp; Technology,
ICT, Science, and Character and Citizenship Education . This programme
aims to equip students with the skills and mindset needed to navigate the
complexities and challenges of the digital age, marked by rapid social
and economic transformation. It seeks to inspire lifelong learning, fostering
creative confidence in students to generate innovative solutions to real-world
problems.</p>
<p>Hua Yians participate in Tier 1 cohort-wide programmes like programming
lessons using M5GO which is in collaboration with iMDA and the Tier 2 Interest
Area Programmes such as STEM-related competitions and applied learning
at the ITEs and Polytechnics. The ALP Committee also provides students
with industrial attachment opportunities through its Tier 3 programmes.</p>
<p>This year, Hua Yi introduced Makerspace workshops where students can engage
in design and maker activities in areas of their interest. In Semester
1, students expanded their learning by engaging in block programming to
design aerial drone shows. The workshop was both enjoyable and beneficial,
offering students valuable hands-on experience.</p>
<p>Aligned with this year's school theme, 'Passing It On!', the committee,
in collaboration with Dunman Secondary School and North East CDC, organized
two Values In Action (VIA) maker activities for different age groups. The
Student Tech Champions led a workshop for children aged 4-6, guiding them
in designing and decorating their own BoomBox. The Art Club hosted a second
activity, working with senior citizens to create and design hats and fans.
All products were made using recyclable materials, fostering creativity
and sustainability throughout the projects.</p>
<p><em>ALP has broadened my understanding of the basics of coding. It’s fun to experiment with the M5GO and other small gadgets, and I’ve learned so much more about them. My group created a push-up sensor, and it was exciting to do the coding, build the base, and celebrate when we finally completed the task.</em>

<p><em>The ALP lessons were fun and engaging, as learning coding was a new and enjoyable experience. The trainers were especially helpful during lessons, offering support when we had questions or faced challenges. If given the chance, I would love to attend more ALP lessons.</em>

<p><em>ALP allows me to learn more about technology and gives me the opportunity to bond with my friends as we work together in a team. Despite the limited time during these lessons, they still encourage me to think creatively, and I find them very enjoyable. It was an excellent experience that pushed me out of my comfort zone and allowed me to try something new.</em>
