**"The learning module I took in ITE was to me, fun and exciting, as it was a first experiencing what life could be after secondary school… In the future this module will help a lot whenever I decide to start a business as I’ve learnt the basics to starting one."**  <br>

#### Programme

#####  Tier 1 

The Secondary 2 Tier 1 ALP aims to promote active living by having students design gadgets for a targeted age group using Arduino, a programming software. The Design Thinking framework is adopted to guide them in their project. In the process of preparation, students crafted presentation slides and videos using their iPads during the Independent Learning Days.
