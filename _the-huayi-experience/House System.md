<p>The House system in Hua Yi aims to give students an identity within the
school, and a sense of pride in a supportive and secure environment. Each
class is allocated to one of the five Houses in Hua Yi and will remain
in the same House throughout their four/five years in the school.</p>
<p>The school plans House activities for the school, which are carried out
during House Days. These activities are designed to build camaraderie amongst
the students within each House, and throughout the year, various school
programmes and activities tap on the House system to generate a sense of
healthy competition between the students of each House.</p>
<p>This contributes to an overall culture of vibrancy in Hua Yi, as students
work together with peers from other classes and levels to compete for the
title of House Champion every year!</p>
