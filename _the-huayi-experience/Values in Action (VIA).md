<h2>Values-in-Action (VIA)</h2>
<p>In Hua Yi, Values-in-Action (VIA) activities are class-based and CCA-based
learning experiences designed to imbue our students with a sense of responsibility
and the desire to make a difference, so that they may continue to serve
and contribute to the community after they leave Hua Yi.</p>
<h5>SECONDARY 1</h5>

<p>Secondary 1 students make use of the Design Thinking framework to propose
solutions to environmental issues and exercise social responsibility in
their spheres of influence. Through this process, they not only develop
innovative ideas but also actively implement their proposed solutions,
taking concrete steps to conserve the environment. This hands-on approach
enables students to translate their learning into meaningful action, making
a tangible impact in their school and community.</p>
<h5>SECONDARY 2</h5>

<p>Secondary 2 students help to promote a good cause by involving themselves
in projects that aim to make a positive impact on seniors in the Jurong
Community. Our students are involved in planning and executing educational
and interactive activities that support active and healthy aging among
the elderly.</p>
<h5>UPPER SECONDARY</h5>

<p>Upper Secondary students are engaged in Service Learning projects where
they design, implement, and evaluate student-initiated activities to benefit
various beneficiaries of their choices. These projects expose students
to various social causes and encourage them to collaboratively develop
innovative solutions for meaningful community impact.</p>
<p>Through these VIA activities, our students grow into empathetic, socially
aware individuals who actively contribute to the betterment of society.</p>
