## Values-in-Action (VIA)

In Hua Yi, Values-in-Action (VIA) activities are class-based and CCA-based learning experiences designed to imbue our students with a sense of responsibility and the desire to make a difference, so that they may continue to serve and contribute to the community after they leave Hua Yi.

**"I learned in the Environmental Sustainability IPW that the Semakau landfill is piling up very quickly because of food and trash wastage. Iâ€™m glad that we have the chance to suggest solutions to help prevent global warming****."**<br>

Secondary 1 students are immersed in Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW), where they apply what they have learnt in their Humanities and Science lessons on Environmental Sustainability into their Service Learning projects. Students make use of the Design Thinking framework to propose solutions to environmental issues and exercise social responsibility in their spheres of influence.

Secondary 2 students help to promote a good cause by involving themselves in projects that aim to make a positive impact on seniors in the Jurong Community. This year, our students had the opportunity to have interactive sessions with these seniors online and created rich resources for elderly centres to engage their seniors.

Upper Secondary students participate in their Service Learning projects where they take the lead in designing, implementing and evaluating their service activities. In 2021, the Secondary 3 students also worked to apply what they learned in their Applied Learning Programme (ALP) to fulfil the needs of the community group they chose to work with.
