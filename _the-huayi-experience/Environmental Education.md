## Environmental Education

Environmental Education in Hua Yi aims to instil the belief that the school community is a seed bed for micro-green movements, and students are the ambassadors for a Green Singapore. Our programme focuses on student engagement and development in projects that promote recycling and appreciating the people who keep our environment safe and clean.

From 2020 to date, we have collaborated with different departments to ensure that our environmental message is advocated at every possible opportunity. The Environmental Education Committee has successfully conducted an inaugural “E-waste Collection” project, and we have also continued to share relevant and timely environmental messages in the classroom through our “Green Issues” modules. In the midst of the global pandemic, we have also found the opportunity to tap on Hua Yians’ spirit of Togetherness to appreciate our frontliners and school support staff, and recognise their efforts to ensure that Hua Yi remains a safe and clean environment for all.

**"It was a great feeling to give the cards and talk to the cleaners of Hua Yi. I’ve learnt that recognising the cleaners makes them happy and appreciated; it also makes me feel grateful that we have cleaners who make Hua Yi clean.”** <br>
