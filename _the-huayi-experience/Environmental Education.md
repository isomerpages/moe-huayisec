<h2>Environmental Education</h2>
<p>In line with the sustainability agenda outlined in the Singapore Green
Plan 2023, the Environmental Education in Hua Yi focuses on empowering
students to contribute to environmental conservation. We focus on promoting
environmental sustainability, fostering interest in the environment, and
cultivating eco-friendly behaviors, guided by the 4C framework. We offer
opportunities for Environmental Ambassadors to participate and lead various
environmental projects, including flagship initiatives like “HYClean”,
“Bring Your Own Cutleries day”, "Dengue Awareness Campaign", and "Hua Yi
Cleaners’ Appreciation". Beyond project leadership, EAs enhance their skills
through workshops and competitions such as the in-house edible garden workshop
and the “Green Guardian Leadership Programme”, empowering Sec 3 EAs to
propose environmental initiatives for school implementation.</p>
<p>We also educate students on current environmental issues through initiatives
like the "Earth week programme" and morning assembly posters. This year,
we introduced a RVM machine to encourage recycling and a “reward card”
to incentivize eco-friendly actions. Additionally, we collaborated with
external agencies on the “Seeds of Hope” project to amplify our EAs' contributions
to society through environmental efforts. Our committee firmly believes
that every Hua Yian has the potential to be an eco-steward who cherishes,
nurtures, and actively contributes to environmental conservation.</p>
