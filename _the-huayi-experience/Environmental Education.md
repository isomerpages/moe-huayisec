<p>In line with the sustainability agenda outlined in the Singapore Green
Plan 2030, the Environmental Education in Hua Yi focuses on empowering
students to contribute to environmental conservation. We focus on promoting
environmental sustainability, fostering interest in the environment, and
cultivating eco-friendly behaviors, guided by the 4C framework. We offer
opportunities for Environmental Ambassadors to participate and lead various
environmental projects, including flagship initiatives like “HYClean”,
“Bring Your Own Cutleries day”, "Dengue Awareness Campaign", and "Hua Yi
Cleaners’ Appreciation". Beyond project leadership, EAs enhance their skills
through workshops and competitions such as the in-house edible garden workshop.</p>
<p>Environmental education is delivered through the "Earth Week programme"
and morning assembly talks, with recycling strongly encouraged. Environmental
awareness is integrated into the curriculum, particularly in science and
humanities subjects. The Eco-Stewardship Programme Committee extends its
environmental initiatives to staff members, maintaining our core belief
that each Hua Yian possesses the potential to be an environmental steward
who appreciates, preserves, and takes action towards environmental sustainability.</p>
