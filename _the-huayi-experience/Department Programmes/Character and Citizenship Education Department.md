#### Learning Outcomes

<img style="width:70%" src="/images/CCE Diagram-1.png">

Hua Yi believes in nurturing students’ holistic development by inculcating values and building competencies. The design of the school’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Curriculum takes reference from MOE’s CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame and is aligned to school goals.

In CCE, we aim to develop in our students:  
*   Good Character
*   Resilience and Social-Emotional Well-Being
*   Active Citizenship
*   Future Readiness

In Hua Yi, a holistic approach to CCE, which involves explicit teaching and reinforcement and application of learning, is adopted. Multiple learning platforms are tapped on to help students internalise values, social-emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions. These platforms include CCE Lessons, key Student Development Experiences, and school-based initiatives.

#### Key Programmes

##### CCE Lessons

CCE lessons are conducted twice weekly by form teachers. These lessons provide the time for teachers to engage and build relationships with their students through discussions and effective classroom strategies. CCE lesson time is used for the following:  

*   Explicit teaching of values and social-emotional competencies for holistic development of students
*   Equipping students with knowledge and skills to better understand real-world contexts
*   Discussion of contemporary issues which aim to develop them into active citizens who practise critical thinking, by helping them understand the multiple perspectives on current issues. With effect from 2021, contemporary issues will be discussed fortnightly during CCE lessons.

##### Student Development Experiences

Every school experience has the potential to be transformed into a CCE lesson when students are guided to learn, apply and demonstrate values, character, social-emotional competencies and citizenship dispositions. Student Development Exercises (SDEs) are programmes and activities that contribute towards the holistic development of our students in the physical, aesthetic, intellectual, moral and social domains. In Hua Yi, SDEs include CCA, outdoor adventure cohort camps, VIA, cohort learning journeys, ECG Experiences, NE Commemorative Days, the NRIC Presentation Ceremony and Student Leadership Development Programmes.
