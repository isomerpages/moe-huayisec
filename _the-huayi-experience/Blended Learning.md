<p>Blended Learning (BL) has been a regular feature of Hua Yi school experience
since 2021, to support MOE’s ongoing efforts to promote lifelong learning
by encouraging the development of self-directed, independent, and passionate
learners in line with our desired student outcomes of developing Passionate
Learners and Resilient Leaders.</p>
<p>To achieve the intended outcomes of BL in Hua Yi, two components - JOY
(to stand for Joy of learning; Ownership of learning; and applY learning)
and Project Sandbox - are integrated into the curriculum.</p>
<h4>Curriculum Coverage - JOY@Hua Yi</h4>
<p>JOY offers our students opportunities to engage in problem-based learning,
connecting knowledge acquired across different subjects. Throughout this
problem-solving process, teachers act as facilitators rather than dispensers
of knowledge, encouraging students to develop creative and critical thinking
skills and use problems to motivate learning. Each JOY cycle concludes
with students expressing their learning in unique ways — from videos and
written reports to songs and other creative formats.</p>
<h4>Student Initiated Learning - Project Sandbox@Hua Yi</h4>
<p>As part of BL, every fortnight, students have the opportunity to pursue
interests of their choice and at their own pace. In Hua Yi, Student Initiated
Learning is termed Project Sandbox to connote a safe environment that provides
opportunities for experimentation and play in a way suggestive of children
playing in a playground.</p>
<p>Project Sandbox enables students to exercise agency, explore interests
and passions, and learn beyond the curriculum. Students can choose to pursue
interests in broad areas such as Sports &amp; Fitness, Music, Botany, Art
&amp; Craft, Languages and Digital Literacy. The activities are not meant
to be demanding and are not assessed. Each semester, students will share
and celebrate their learning with their peers through the Learning Festival.</p>
