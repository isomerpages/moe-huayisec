<p>Hua Yi’s approach to Blended Learning is aligned with MOE’s objectives,
providing students with opportunities to take greater ownership of their
learning, while developing self-efficacy, self-awareness, and self-management
skills. This is achieved through a thoughtful integration of student-driven
learning experiences and structured curriculum coverage.</p>
<p>Through Blended Learning, teachers leverage the strengths of both in-person
and distance learning to design lessons that are best suited to each mode
of engagement. This approach also enables teachers to create meaningful
learning experiences that may be challenging to implement within the constraints
of classroom time or large-group settings, thereby enriching students’
learning beyond the physical classroom.</p>
<p>Blended Learning at Hua Yi comprises two key components:</p>
<p><strong>1. Student-Initiated Learning: Project Sandbox</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>
<br>Project Sandbox, conducted on even-week Friday afternoons, empowers students
to take ownership of their learning through the exploration of personal
interests such as Art and Craft, Digital Literacy, Languages, Music, Sports
and Fitness, and Technology. Students initiate ideas and drive their own
learning, with teachers supporting them as mentors across learning contexts
in and beyond school.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Foster self-directed learning and encourage students to pursue their passions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills through
experiential learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultivate teacher–student partnerships that support student agency and
reflective learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Curriculum Coverage on Home-Based Learning Days (HBL)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>
<br>Home-Based Learning (HBL) days are scheduled across the year to support
meaningful curriculum learning beyond the classroom. Lessons are thoughtfully
designed to enable students to learn independently, consolidate key concepts,
and apply their learning to real-life contexts through a range of self-directed,
applied, and collaborative activities. Learning takes place through a combination
of synchronous and asynchronous modes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Teachers leverage digital platforms such as the Singapore Student
Learning Space (SLS) and Google Classroom to provide timely feedback and
opportunities for self-assessment. Learning experiences are differentiated
to cater to students’ readiness levels, interests, and learning preferences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In Term 3, students also experience three consecutive days of HBL
during the national oral examinations. Guided by the principles of <strong>JOY — Joy in Learning, Ownership of Learning, and Applying Learning</strong>,
students engage in integrated project work and apply their learning to
authentic, real-world problems.</p>
