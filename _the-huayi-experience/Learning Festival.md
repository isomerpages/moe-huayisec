The Learning Festival is a school programme customised and designed to encourage Hua Yians to embrace a culture of learning together as well as the philosophy of lifelong learning. By participating in a range of programmes from different domains, Hua Yians are able to deepen their learning, explore new interests and also pursue their passions.

In May 2021, we had our first ever Virtual Learning Festival. With the aid of technology, students remained connected to their friends as they learned a skill of their choice together, tuned in to hear the life and work experiences of invited speakers from different industries, worked on assigned tasks and shared their experiences and insights with their teachers and friends through photo journals and other digital artefacts. Hua Yians have indeed taken this new experience to explore the different possibilities of learning and demonstrated much resilience, creativity and innovation through it!
