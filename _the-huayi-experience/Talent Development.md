<h4>Inspiring Talents</h4>
<p>At Hua Yi, our Talent Development Programme embodies the school’s vision
of inspiring talents by fostering a collaborative, whole-school, three-tiered
support system that empowers every student to reach their fullest potential.
Through close coordination among the Talent Development committee, IP departments,
and SDT-related committees, the programme identifies and nurtures diverse
talents, offering structured opportunities for students to expand their
abilities, deepen their skills, and build essential 21st Century Competencies
(E21CC). This supportive framework enables our students to face future
challenges with confidence, reflecting our commitment to developing passionate,
capable, and globally-aware individuals</p>

<h4>Illustration of Opportunities for Growth and Learning</h4>
<p>Students are engaged in a variety of enriching activities that foster
critical thinking, public speaking, and innovative problem-solving skills.
Participation in initiatives such as Model United Nations (MUN) and the
Future Problem-Solving Programme (FPSP) hones their analytical and collaborative
abilities while fostering an awareness of complex global issues, thereby
aligning closely with our commitment to developing responsible, globally-minded
citizens.</p>
<h4>Mentorship and External Partnerships</h4>
<p>In addition to school-based programmes, the Talent Development Programme
offers students select opportunities to engage with mentors from external
organizations, providing a valuable extension to their learning. For example,
a collaboration with scientists from Singapore Management University on
the Cool Paint Research Project introduces students to scientific inquiry
within a practical context, allowing them to gain insights and apply their
knowledge in meaningful ways. These partnerships offer students a glimpse
into real-world applications, supporting their growth and sparking new
interests.</p>
<h4>Students’ sharing</h4>
<p><em>Participating in FPSP allowed me to acquire numerous skills applicable to the future and provided opportunities for self-expression. I learned problem-solving techniques and procedures, made new friends, and improved my teamwork and idea-sharing skills. Overall, FPSP was a tremendously fun experience, and I appreciate the opportunity.</em>

<p><em>Through MUN, I gained skills in delivering speeches confidently and collaborating with other delegates to create solutions. The heated debates deepened my understanding of global political issues, sparking my interest in politics. MUN has helped me build confidence in public speaking and critical thinking, and I've enjoyed making many new friends. I look forward to participating in more MUNs!</em>
