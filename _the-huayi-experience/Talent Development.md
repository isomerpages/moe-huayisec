Hua Yians possess abilities which can be nurtured to excellence while experiencing the joy of learning. The vision of the Talent Development Programme (TDP) at Hua Yi (TDP@HY) is to give attention and recognition to studentsâ€™ strengths and talents in order to develop them into passionate learners and glocalised citizens.

The TDP develops students cognitively through an intensive and rigorous training programme, mainly in preparation for the Model United Nations and Destination Imagination competitions, in addition to other opportunities which may arise over the course of the year.

In the Model United Nations, students are assigned the roles of delegates from different countries to the United Nations (UN) and its councils. Through these sessions, students gain valuable knowledge about international relations and skills such as research, critical thinking, public speaking and negotiation.

In the Destination Imagination tournament, participants are involved in creative and collaborative problem-solving projects. Students step up to the challenge of creating a unique presentation for a panel of judges which highlights their problem-solving skills.

**"My participation in Destination Imagination helped sharpen many skills such as critical thinking, creativity and presentation skills. The ties forged and the enriching experiences are something that could never been gained from textbook or classroom lessons alone."** <br>
