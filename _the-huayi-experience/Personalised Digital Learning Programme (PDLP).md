## Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP)

**REQUIRE JACKSON'S INPUT YOUTUBE VIDEO**

Embracing the use of technology to spark the joy of learning in our students and inspire their pursuit of excellence, Hua Yi has rolled out the use of iPads to all our Secondary 1, 2 and 3 students in 2021. With the latest educational apps at their fingertips, students can learn independently as well as collaboratively, both within and beyond the classroom.

PDLP has unleashed the creativity of our teachers and transformed the learning experiences of our students. The use of Google classrooms, e-books and MOE's Singapore Student Learning Space creates a more impactful and exciting learning experience for Hua Yians. Our students now have opportunities to showcase their learning in varied ways, including animated designs and virtual musical performances. PDLP ushers in exciting possibilities for teaching and learning in Hua Yi, and we are greatly enthused by the journey ahead!

#### Personal Learning Device

Every Hua Yian will be using the Apple iPad as their personal learning device. Every iPad will come bundled with the Apple pencil and keyboard to maximise the affordances of the iPad as a learning tool.  
  
Not only is the iPad a portable device that offers students convenient learning on-the-move, it also allows for a seamless learning experience alongside existing learning technologies such as the Student Learning Space (SLS) and Team Model Smarter Classroom System. In addition to apps within Apple’s eco-system, students will also gain access a wide range of programmes from other developers (eg. Google Suite and Microsoft Office etc), making it the device of choice in developing students’ application and creative skills.

Each bundle consists of: <br>
1 \. Apple iPad 10.2" 64gb Wifi <br>
2 \. Logitech Ruggedized Keyboard Case <br>
3 \. Apple Pencil
