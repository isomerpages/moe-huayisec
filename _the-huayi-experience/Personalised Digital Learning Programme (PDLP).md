<p>Embracing the use of technology to spark the joy of learning in our students
and inspire their pursuit of excellence, Hua Yi has rolled out the use
of iPads to all our Secondary 1, 2 and 3 students in 2021. With the latest
educational apps at their fingertips, students can learn independently
as well as collaboratively, both within and beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>PDLP has unleashed the creativity of our teachers and transformed the
learning experiences of our students. The use of Google classrooms, e-books
and MOE's Singapore Student Learning Space creates a more impactful and
exciting learning experience for Hua Yians. Our students now have opportunities
to showcase their learning in varied ways, including animated designs and
virtual musical performances. PDLP ushers in exciting possibilities for
teaching and learning in Hua Yi, and we are greatly enthused by the journey
ahead!</p>

</div>
<p>Every Hua Yian will be using the Apple iPad as their personal learning
device. Every iPad will come bundled with the Apple pencil and keyboard
to maximise the affordances of the iPad as a learning tool.</p>
<p>Not only is the iPad a portable device that offers students convenient
learning on-the-move, it also allows for a seamless learning experience
alongside existing learning technologies such as the Student Learning Space
(SLS). In addition to apps within Apple’s eco-system, students will also
gain access a wide range of programmes from other developers (eg. Google
Suite and Microsoft Office etc), making it the device of choice in developing
students’ application and creative skills.</p>
<p>Each bundle consists of:
<br>1 . Apple iPad 10.9" 128gb Wifi
<br>2 . Logitech Ruggedized Keyboard Case
<br>3 . Apple Pencil</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Digital Citizenship and Cyber Wellness</h4>
<p>As Hua Yi develops its students to develop the digital skills that enables
their learning, it is also imperative that they are empowered to take responsibility
for their personal well-being when using technology.</p>

<p>The school adopts MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework to develop students into
responsible digital citizens. Hua Yians’ attitudes and behaviour on the
use of technology are guided by the 3 Cyber&nbsp; Wellness Principles.
These principles are constantly reinforced when students engage in the
“Sense-Think-Act” process, which serves as a structure for them to use
technology safely and meaningfully for their learning and interactions.</p>
<h4>Financial Assistance</h4>
<p>For students who need support:</p>
<p>i. Singapore Citizens students whose gross household income (GHI) is $4,000
and below or whose per capita income (PCI) is $1000 and below, should complete
and submit the application&nbsp;form and supporting income documents to
the Hua Yi General Office.</p>
<p>Please obtain the hard copies of the application form from the General
Office.</p>
<p>ii. Permanent residents (PR) and international students (IS) should also

<h4>Roll-Out of IT Applications as part of National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)</h4>
<p>As part of the NDLP, schools will progressively roll out IT applications
that will be vital to students’ learning experience and educational journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;<strong>Student iCON:</strong>&nbsp;MOE will give every secondary
school student an email address. This is a service provided by Google as
part of Google Suite.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft Pro Plus:</strong>&nbsp;every secondary school
will be granted a licence to use Microsoft Office tools that include Word,
PowerPoint and Excel.</p>
<p>The school will need to use your child/ward’s personal data such as his/her
name and class to set up user accounts. Please refer to our Frequently
Asked Questions section for more information on the collection of data
via these applications.</p>
<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<h5>Data Protection</h5>
<p>1 . How will my child/ward’s data be used in the PLD and IT Applications?</p>
<p><strong>IT Applications.</strong>&nbsp;For the IT Applications (student
iCON, Microsoft ProPlus and Zoom), the school will use your child/ward’s
personal data such as his/her name, birth certificate number and class
to set up user accounts. This data will also be used for the purposes of
authenticating and verifying user identity, troubleshooting and facilitating
system improvements. In addition, the commercial providers of these platforms
(e.g. Google, Microsoft) will collect and deal with user data generated
by your child/ward’s use of these applications. The collection use and
disclosure of such data are governed by the commercial provider’s terms
of use, which can be found here:&nbsp;</p>
