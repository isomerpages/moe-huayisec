A nucleus is the central and most important part of a movement or group, which also forms the basis for its activity and growth. It is the heart — pivotal and crucial to the success of a community. In Hua Yi, our students are our nuclei, and it is our aim to nurture our students to be leaders who engage with people from all walks of life and to interact with them empathetically. We hope that these experiences will develop the value of resilience within our students.

Similar to the nuclei in cells, a lighthouse’s pivotal role is to direct the movements of vessels in the sea. Hua Yi hopes that our students will work together to become beacons of hope in our community, and to create and direct meaningful movements in the world.

**"I used to think that togetherness was merely about accomplishing tasks in group settings, but through the experiences of the \[Student Leaders\] Camp, I realised that togetherness was seeking happiness in doing things together."** <br>

#### Objectives

Hua Yi’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) focuses on Community Youth Leadership. It aims to help students develop life skills and values, while supporting them in discovering their strengths, interests and talents. It provides students with a broad and deep foundation for lifelong learning and equips them to lead purposeful lives.

#### Learning Outcomes

We focus on providing students with opportunities to lead in serving the community, developing them as leaders of empathy, through serving the community.

#### Programme

##### Tier 1

All students will be equipped with knowledge of the Leadership Challenge Module — Model the Way, Enable Others to Act, Encourage the Heart, Inspire a Shared Vision and Challenge the Process. The five Practices are extracted from the book, Student Leadership Practice Inventory, by James Kouzes and Barry Posner.  
  
With this leadership knowledge, the LLP will be an extension of students’ Values-in-Action (VIA) experiences, and provide many other relevant opportunities for students to broaden their understanding of the needs and aspirations of the community. These will be realised through authentic experiences that will deepen their development of leadership skills and attitudes.

##### Tier 2

Building on the knowledge of the Leadership Challenge Model, the Student Leadership programmes in Hua Yi aim to develop Hua Yians as exemplary leaders who are grounded in values.  
  
The Student Leadership Developmental Plan aims to develop all students to Model the Way by affirming shared values such as our School Values and School Philosophy. Students will also Encourage the Heart when they recognise the strengths and celebrate the achievements of their peers or team members. Additionally, students will engage in collaborative learning during group tasks to Enable Others to Act before Challenging the Process by looking out for opportunities to make improvements, experimenting and learning from their failures. Lastly, all students will be able to Inspire a Shared Vision when they are able to motivate others to work towards common goals.  
  
Through selection, appointment and training, Hua Yians are nurtured to develop their leadership competencies and be stretched to develop their potential in one of four leadership groups.

##### Tier 3

Besides going through the Tier 1 and Tier 2 milestone trainings, outstanding student leaders will be nominated to attend the Tier 3 developmental programme, which will prepare them to take on greater challenges beyond the school. Tier 3 programmes focus on application, where student leaders are given opportunities to apply the knowledge and skills learned in training.
