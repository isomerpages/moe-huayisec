<h2>Learning for Life Programme (LLP)</h2>
<h4>COMMUNITY YOUTH LEADERSHIP</h4>
<p>LLP aims to help students develop life skills and values, while supporting
them in discovering their strengths, interests and talents. It provides
students with a broad and deep foundation for lifelong learning, and equips
them to lead purposeful lives.</p>

<p>A nucleus is the central and most important part of a movement or group,
which also forms the basis for its activity and growth. It is the heart
— pivotal and crucial to the success of a community. In Hua Yi, our students
are our nuclei, and it is our aim to nurture our students to be leaders
who engage with people from all walks of life and to interact with them
empathetically. We hope that these experiences will develop the value of
resilience within our students.</p>
<p>Similar to the nuclei in cells, a lighthouse’s pivotal role is to direct
the movements of vessels in the sea. Hua Yi hopes that our students will
work together to become beacons of hope in our community, and to create
and direct meaningful movements in the world.</p>
<h4>Objectives</h4>
<p>Hua Yi’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) focuses on Community Youth
Leadership. It aims to help students develop life skills and values, while
supporting them in discovering their strengths, interests and talents.
It provides students with a broad and deep foundation for lifelong learning
and equips them to lead purposeful lives.</p>
<h4>Learning Outcomes</h4>
<p>We focus on providing students with opportunities to lead in serving the
community, developing them as leaders of empathy, through serving the community.</p>
<h4>Programme</h4>

<p>A three-tiered approach is taken to provide authentic development opportunities,
such as Values In Action (VIA) experiences, for all Hua Yians to learn,
serve and live in communities with diverse needs. Students will also broaden
their understanding of the needs and aspirations of the community and deepen
their development of leadership skills and attitudes to be a confident
leader.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>Tier 1</h5>
<p>All students will be equipped with knowledge of the Leadership Challenge
Module — Model the Way, Enable Others to Act, Encourage the Heart, Inspire
a Shared Vision and Challenge the Process. The five Practices are extracted
from the book, Student Leadership Practice Inventory, by James Kouzes and
Barry Posner.</p>
<p>With this leadership knowledge, the LLP will be an extension of students’
Values-in-Action (VIA) experiences, and provide many other relevant opportunities
for students to broaden their understanding of the needs and aspirations
of the community. These will be realised through authentic experiences
that will deepen their development of leadership skills and attitudes.</p>
<h5>Tier 2</h5>

</div>
<p>Building on the knowledge of the Leadership Challenge Model, the Student
Leadership programmes in Hua Yi aim to develop Hua Yians as exemplary leaders
who are grounded in values.</p>
<p>The Student Leadership Developmental Plan aims to develop all students
to Model the Way by affirming shared values such as our School Values and
School Philosophy. Students will also Encourage the Heart when they recognise
the strengths and celebrate the achievements of their peers or team members.
Additionally, students will engage in collaborative learning during group
tasks to Enable Others to Act before Challenging the Process by looking
out for opportunities to make improvements, experimenting and learning
from their failures. Lastly, all students will be able to Inspire a Shared
Vision when they are able to motivate others to work towards common goals.
Hua Yians will be developed to be a resilient and confident leader.</p>
<p>Through selection, appointment and training, Hua Yians are nurtured to
develop their leadership competencies and be stretched to develop their
potential in one of eight leadership groups.</p>
<h5>Tier 3</h5>

</div>
<p>Besides going through the Tier 1 and Tier 2 milestone trainings, outstanding
student leaders will be nominated to attend the Tier 3 developmental programme,
which will prepare them to take on greater challenges beyond the school.
Tier 3 programmes focus on application, where student leaders are given
opportunities to apply the knowledge and skills learned in training. Tier
3 Student leaders lead their respective student leaders groups to organise
school-based signature programmes and in addition they are also given the
opportunity to participate in a Service Learning Trip overseas. They will
plan and/or engage in various activities to exercise leadership competencies
with excellence, and in the process, develop service leadership beyond
borders.</p>
