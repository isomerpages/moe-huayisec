<p>Building on our school’s rich history and heritage, Hua Yi has established
sustainable and strategic home-school-community partnerships with various
stakeholders in collaborations which support a wide range of holistic learning
experiences. We believe in providing authentic learning opportunities for
students to nurture the joy of learning and the drive to succeed as creators
and connectors, as well as to develop the desire to contribute and create
a positive impact on the community.</p>
<p>Other than engaging stakeholders – the School Advisory Committee, Parent
Support Group, and Hua Yi Alumni Society – to communicate and seek feedback
on developments in the educational landscape as well as school plans, Hua
Yi also collaborates and works closely with both community and international
partners.</p>
<p>Together with our valuable partners such as Corporation Primary, St Luke’s,
NTUC Health, Lion Befrienders, St Andrew Nursing Home, Jurong Green CC,
Southwest CDC, Fei Yue Community Services, Halogen Foundation, and Wisdom
Nest, Hua Yi provides authentic opportunities for our students to serve
the community and engage meaningfully with both the young and the elderly.
These experiences allow our school to achieve desired outcomes of developing
outward-looking, compassionate, and responsible individuals.</p>
<p>Our eco-stewardship partners, which include the Singapore Penjing and
Stone Appreciation Society, FairPrice Group, Warburg Vending Pte Ltd, and
ALBA E-Waste, further broaden students’ learning beyond the classroom.
Through initiatives such as bonsai appreciation, gifting and sharing projects,
recycling drives, and e-waste collection campaigns, students gain cultural
awareness while cultivating sustainable habits and reflecting on the importance
of empathy, resource conservation, and responsible disposal practices.</p>
<p>Through these diverse partnerships, Hua Yi endeavours to shape students’
holistic development – developing their character, leadership skills, cultural
appreciation, and commitment to building a more caring and sustainable
society.</p>
