Our Internationalisation programme partners our school with sister schools from other countries, and allows for meaningful and engaging interactions between students. Through this programme, we hope to enable students to increase their socio-cultural and religious sensitivity, and deepen their appreciation of Singapore’s context in our region and the world. Throughout the years, we have welcomed and hosted students from all over the world, including China, Taiwan, Indonesia, Thailand and Japan, as well as hosted principals and teachers who are curious to experience and understand school life in Singapore.

Some of our Partner Schools in 2021 include:  
*   Rajavinit Mathayom School (Bangkok, Thailand)
*   SMAN 1 Bogor (Bogor, Indonesia)
*   Dayou Junior High School (Taoyuan, Taiwan)
*   Showa Women’s University Junior High School (Tokyo, Japan)

We hope to engage more students in international exchange programmes and activities, especially more so after restrictions are lifted in the future, as we believe that these experiences can enrich our students’ holistic development.
