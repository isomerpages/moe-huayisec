<p>Our Internationalisation programme partners our school with sister schools
from other countries, and allows for meaningful and engaging interactions
between students. Through this programme, we hope to enable students to
increase their socio-cultural and religious sensitivity, and deepen their
appreciation of Singapore’s context in our region and the world. Throughout
the years, we have welcomed and hosted students from all over the world,
including China, Taiwan, Indonesia, Thailand and Japan, as well as hosted
principals and teachers who are curious to experience and understand school
life in Singapore.</p>
<p>Some of our Partner Schools include:</p>
<p>• Rajavinit Mathayom School (Bangkok, Thailand)</p>
<p>• SMAN 1 Bogor (Bogor, Indonesia)</p>
<p>• Meridian International School (Manila, Singapore)</p>
<p>• Longshan Junior High School (Taipei, Taiwan)</p>
<p>• Sekolah Maitreyawira Medan (Medan, Indonesia)</p>
