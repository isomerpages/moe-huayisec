<h2>Hua Yi Alumni Society (HYAS)</h2>
<p>The Hua Yi Alumni Society (HYAS) has continued to strengthen the bonds
between our alumni and their alma mater. Through the organisation of various
signature events and collaborative efforts, HYAS has successfully gathered
talents and resources to support Hua Yi in achieving her goals and aspirations.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the Alumni are playing a key role in the preparations for
Hua Yi’s 70th Anniversary in 2026. Working closely with the school, they
are helping to lay the foundations for a meaningful celebration that will
honour Hua Yi’s rich heritage and inspire confidence for the future. Their
involvement not only reflects their gratitude to the school, but also their
commitment to rallying fellow alumni to contribute their time, expertise,
and resources.</p>
<p>Guided by the school’s core principles of benevolence, justice, wisdom,
and togetherness, our alumni strive to live out these values in their daily
lives. In turn, they bring these values back to the school—raising standards
in academics, niche areas, Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs), and community
service. The enduring support of the Hua Yi Alumni ensures that the Hua
Yi spirit will continue to thrive across generations.</p>
<p>The HYAS seeks to:</p>
<p>1. Support the goals and objectives of the school in collaboration with
the School Leaders</p>
<p>2. Galvanise the resources of former students to advance the aspirations
of their alma mater</p>
<p>3. Initiate programmes and activities to instil in current students a
sense of affiliation and pride in the school</p>
<p>As Hua Yi looks towards her 70th Anniversary and beyond, HYAS will remain
a vital bridge between past, present, and future Hua Yians—uniting generations
in a shared spirit of gratitude, service, and pride.</p>
