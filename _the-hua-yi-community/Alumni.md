The Hua Yi Alumni Society (HYAS) has, through the past few years of organising various signature events, succeeded in gathering talents and resources to achieve its objective of supporting Hua Yi in her goals and objectives. With the guiding principles of benevolence, justice, wisdom and togetherness that Hua Yi has provided them as foundations for their lives, the Alumni now assist the school in raising her standards in academics, niche areas, Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) and community service as a way to exemplify the values that Hua Yi has imparted to them. The brand name of Hua Yi resonates under the staunch support of the Hua Yi Alumni, many of whom have returned to their alma mater to contribute in one way or another over the last five years.

The&nbsp;HYAS&nbsp;seeks to: <br>
1 \.  Support the goal and objectives of the school in collaboration with the School Leaders<br>
2 \.  Galvanise the resources of former students of the school to achieve the goals and objectives of their&nbsp;_alma mater_<br>
3 \.  Initiate programmes and activities to instil in our students a sense of affiliation to and pride in the school
