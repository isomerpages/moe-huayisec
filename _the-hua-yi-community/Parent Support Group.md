<p>Hua Yi has an active and dedicated Parent Support Group (PSG) which supports
school programmes and activities for students’ holistic development. The
PSG’s vision is to work closely with the school to provide the best support
in educating our children. Parents with rich life experiences are invited
to join us so that we can provide strategic support through networking
and common resources.</p>
<p>The PSG seeks to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Strengthen the structure of the PSG to better support Hua Yians in their
learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop platforms for parents to nurture positive family relationships
with their children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish strong engagement between the school and the PSG to broaden
the learning experiences of students</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage parents as partners to prepare Hua Yians with knowledge, skills
and values to be future-ready</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Members of the PSG are very active in reaching out to parents of our students
to offer support in engaging and motivating their children. Some of the
activities they are involved in throughout the year include the Secondary
1 School Leader’s Talk, Parenting workshops and meetings, Values-in-Action
(VIA) projects, as well as showing appreciation to teachers during Teachers’
Day.</p>
