#### A Wholesome Learning Experience

Currently a JC1 student at Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC), Faith discovered her love for the arts back in Hua Yi. She entered JPJC through DSA via Politics and History to pursue the humanities.

“The Hua Yi brand of education was very holistic and well-grounded in the school values of 仁、义、智、群, and as such, I found myself in a wholesome atmosphere that encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone and try new things,” shares Faith. Some of these included the Model United Nation conferences she experienced as a school delegate, which she credits for honing her speaking skills and exposing her to the different facets of both global and local politics. This deepened her love for geopolitics and history.

Having taken Literature in Hua Yi, Faith also got the chance to participate in poetry competitions and workshops. “It was when I performed a poem on stage with my friend Fazila, that I truly found myself. Till this day I continue to write and I am glad Hua Yi ignited and solidified my love for Literature and poetry.” Today, Faith is part of the Creative Arts Programme (Singapore) under poetry and many of her poems have been inspired by her time in Hua Yi.

The four years spent in Hua Yi have become an unforgettable part of Faith’s life, who fondly remembers the people, the school building and even the jokes and little moments of joy. She recalls spending every morning exercising with Ms Lee and a few friends in Secondary 4, which gave her something to look forward to each day, and motivated her to arrive at school early and enjoy every moment.

_Xinyao_ was also close to her heart, having been instrumental in developing her love for the Chinese language, a subject which she was weaker in when she first entered Hua Yi. “Through Hua Yi, I got to know and appreciate _xinyao_ better. It was one of the first few things that made me fall in love with Chinese and taught me to try my best in my subjects, even if I did badly,” Faith reflects. Indeed, _xinyao_ has been one of the factors that has shaped her worldview and her works, with the moving song lyrics offering her solace and food for thought.

##### _"I guess you can say xinyao grew up with me and nurtured me, just like in the lyrics in ‘华义人’: “华义人离不开母校的枝桠，华义人创造新时代的枝桠。”  Sometimes I feel that I have never truly left, as a part of me matures and grows with the school as the school grows on me."_

Faith encourages to her juniors to embrace their learning experiences at Hua Yi: I want to let you know that you do have a choice to either be part of the statistics or to forge your own path and create your own set of numbers to make a difference. I believe that all of you are capable of the latter. All the best!
