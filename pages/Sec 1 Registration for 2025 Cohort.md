<h4><strong>Important Information for ALL Students</strong></h4>
<p>All Secondary 1 students posted to Hua Yi Secondary school are required
to review through the registration details below carefully. Additional
details will be sent via Parents Gateway (PG).</p>
<p>The e-Registration process will be conducted through PG. Information regarding
class allocation and Subject-Based Banding (SBB) offerings will be shared
on PG, typically 1 - 2 days after the posting is confirmed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Please note: </strong>Parents are strongly encouraged to purchase
uniforms and books <strong>only after receiving the class allocation</strong> on
Parents Gateway.<strong><br><br></strong>The first day of School will be
on <strong><u>Thursday, 2 January 2025.</u></strong>
</p>
<h4><strong>Reporting Time</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>Flag-Raising Ceremony</strong> begins promptly at <strong>7.30am</strong> daily.
All students are expected to be present and prepared before it starts.
To ensure this, students should allow sufficient time to deposit their
bags in the classroom and place their phones in the lockers before proceeding
to the ceremony.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>First Day of School</strong></h4>
<p>On the first day of school, students should report in their Hua Yi PE
Attire with Uniform Bottoms, and gather at their respective Secondary 1
Classroom on Level 4. From there, their seniors will then lead them to
the School Hall (Centrestage) for the Flag-Raising Ceremony.</p>

<p>Students who did not manage to purchase the Hua Yi school uniform can
report in their primary school uniform.</p>
<p>Students will be dismissed at 5.30pm on 2 January after Day 1 of Sec 1
Orientation Camp (S1OC).</p>
<h4><strong>Uniform Guidelines</strong></h4>
