#### An Enriching Experience beyond Academics

Jia Hao is currently in his final year of studies in Mass Communications at Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s (NP) School of Film & Media Studies. He is also running his own business, Lucid Social Marketing Communications on the side, an agency that he started to help companies grow their presence via social media.

Jia Hao feels extremely privileged to have come from Hua Yi and he often tells this to his friends, being a proud graduand who has benefited much from his experiences at Hua Yi. His experience at Hua Yi as a Normal Technical student was hectic but rewarding. He recalled being selected to attend a Broadcast Journalism course, fully paid for by the school, along with other relevant enrichment classes. “These courses helped me even after I left Hua Yi. Having spent two years in ITE, the Broadcast Journalism course has remained relevant in my life, and was eventually one of the reasons that I qualified for NP’s Mass Communications, which had an ‘O’ Level cut-off point of 10 points.”

Navigating through different schools upon graduation from Hua Yi, Jia Hao shares that school culture matters a lot. His experiences at Hua Yi offered him much — from the night study sessions during the ‘N’ level examination period, to being selected for many enrichment courses. He is thankful for these wide-ranging experiences that have enriched his time as a Normal Technical student.  

“I think one of my biggest takeaways from Hua Yi are my friends whom I still keep in contact with till today. We often think about Hua Yi’s school culture fondly, and like how active our alumni are. They organised many events to raise funds, so that we could get additional help and enrichment classes beyond the standard curriculum.”
