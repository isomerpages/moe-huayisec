<p>Hua Yi Secondary School is proud to celebrate the achievements of our
alumna, <strong>Ellean Tsen</strong>, whose inspiring journey into healthcare
is driven by both personal experience and professional passion. Ellean
was our student from <strong>Class of 18-4E.</strong>
</p>
<p>Ellean’s interest in respiratory therapy began after witnessing her mother’s
battle with a pneumothorax and the dedicated care provided by respiratory
therapists. This encounter not only gave her a deeper appreciation of the
profession but also strengthened her determination to pursue this meaningful
path.</p>
<p>After graduating from Hua Yi in 2021, Ellean furthered her studies at
Republic Polytechnic (RP), where she embraced opportunities such as attachments
and job shadowing organised by MOH Holdings (MOHH). These experiences shaped
her career aspirations and affirmed her calling in healthcare. With the
encouragement of her mentor, Dr Ma Shao Kang, she continued to push her
boundaries and believe in her potential.</p>

<p>Today, Ellean is <strong>making history as the first Singaporean to be sent to Taiwan to specialise in respiratory therapy</strong>.
She is currently pursuing her <strong>Bachelor’s in Respiratory Therapy at Chang Gung University</strong>,
and was recently recognised at the <strong>Healthcare Scholarships Award Ceremony</strong> as
one of five RP alumni to receive the prestigious Healthcare Merit Award
(Full Term).</p>
<p>Ellean hopes to learn from Taiwan’s approach to caring for an ageing population
and is eager to contribute new perspectives and innovative practices to
Singapore’s public healthcare sector.</p>
<p>Her journey reflects the spirit of resilience, excellence, and service
that Hua Yi nurtures in our students. We celebrate Ellean’s success and
look forward to the impact she will make in the healthcare profession.</p>
