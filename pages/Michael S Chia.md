<h4>Gleaning Life Lessons from Teachers</h4>
<p>Michael joined Hua Yi in 1984 when the school moved to Depot Road and
had switched to being an English-medium school, after over two decades
as a government Chinese middle school. He is the founder and managing director
of MSC Law Corporation and continues to be actively involved in alumni
affairs at Hua Yi.</p>
<p>Recalling the people who have made an impact during his time at Hua Yi,
Michael shares about Mr Sim Cher Kheng who was his Chinese teacher in Secondary
1 and 2, and also the Discipline Master. To him, Mr Sim was passionate
and positive, firm in discipline but never condescending. “He was always
trying to get the naughtier kids to see things from a different perspective
and always trying to interest us in his bonsai plants. He often used gardening
as a form of discipline.”</p>
<p>Another person whom Michael remembers fondly is Miss Koh Poh Kwee, his
History teacher in Secondary 2. He is grateful for a dedicated teacher
like her who took great pains to make learning interesting and enjoyable
for her students, often conveying historical lessons through lively stories.
“Her enthusiasm rubbed off on me and the year she taught me History was
the only year I ever passed that subject!”</p>
<h5><em>"I hope that Hua Yi continues to be a school that nurtures Hua Yians who are resilient, and who make full use of their knowledge and talents towards the betterment of their community and country."</em></h5>
