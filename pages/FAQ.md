**2 \.  What is Hua Yi’s strategy for Blended Learning?**<br>Blended Learning in Hua Yi takes the form of ILD (Independent Learning Day) every even Friday. There are 2 segments to each session:
1) Curriculum coverage within and outside school, which focuses on JOY - Joy in learning, Ownership of Learning and Applying learning.
2) Student initiated learning called Project Sandbox where students will get the opportunity to pursue interests of their choice such as Sports and Fitness, Music, Art and Craft, Languages, Botany etc. The activities can be pursued in school, at home, or other locations, with teachers acting as mentors and co learners! 

**3 \.  How will the Personal Device be implemented in Hua Yi?**<br>
Every Hua Yian will be using the Apple iPad as their personal learning device. Every iPad will come bundled with the Apple pencil and keyboard to maximise the affordances of the iPad as a learning tool. 

Not only is the iPad a portable device that offers students convenient learning on-the-move, it also allows for a seamless learning experience alongside existing learning technologies such as the Student Learning Space (SLS) and Team Model Smarter Classroom System.&nbsp; For more information on PDLP: <br><a href="https://www.huayisec.moe.edu.sg/the-huayi-experience/pdlp/">https://www.huayisec.moe.edu.sg/the-huayi-experience/pdlp/</a>


**4 \.  How will Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB) look like in Hua Yi?**<br>In 2021, we have integrated the Normal Academic and Normal Technical stream. The integration of both streams is Hua Yi’s first step towards Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB) in 2022 as we celebrate the unique strengths and diversity of our students.

(a) How does FSBB work?
*   When FSBB is fully implemented, students from the Express, Normal (Academic), and Normal (Technical) streams will be merged into a single course of study.
*   All students will attend the same Common Curriculum lessons, but they will go to different classes for the SBB lessons. During SBB lessons, students are offered in ability-banded classes - Express, N(A), and N(T). They will get to interact with other students from another class.

The Common Curriculum comprises the following subjects:
*   Art;
*   Character and Citizenship Education (CCE);
*   Design &amp; Technology;
*   Food and Consumer Education (FCE);
*   Music;
*   Physical Education (PE)

and the SBB subjects offered comprises the following subjects:  
*   English Language;
*   Mother Tongue Languages;
*   Mathematics;
*   Science;
*   Geography;
*   History;
*   Literature in English

**5 \.  Does the school offer SBB?**<br>Hua Yi currently offers Subject-Based Banding (SBB) for English, Mother Tongues, Mathematics, Science, Humanities subjects (Geography and History) and Literature in English. Further information and details about SBB in Hua Yi will be shared during the Secondary 1 Registration event in December.

**6 \.  What is ALP and/ or LLP about?**<br>Some of the highlights of Hua Yi in terms of learning programmes and opportunities given to students can be found in the brochure.

**ALP:** Hua Yi’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) aims to prepare our students for the challenges in this digital age.

The programme will nurture the Joy of Learning in students. Students will work with their peers to generate solutions to real life problems and in the process, their creativity, communication skills and confidence will be developed.&nbsp;

*   Students will get the opportunity to apply what they learn in English Language, Design &amp; Technology, ICT, Science and Character and Citizenship Education (CCE).
*   Students will work on topics related to Health Science and Healthcare Technologies.&nbsp;

**LLP:** Hua Yi Secondary’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) focuses on Community Youth Leadership (CYL). The LLP aims to help students develop life skills and values. Through this, students will discover their strengths, interests and talents.&nbsp;CYL focuses on providing students with opportunities to lead in serving the community and developing them as leaders of empathy.

*   Tier 1: The students will learn about the Leadership Challenge Module - Model the Way, Enable Others to Act, Encourage the Heart, Inspire a Shared Vision and Challenge the Process.
*   Tier 2: Through selection, appointment and training, students are nurtured to develop their leadership skills and they will be stretched to develop their potential in one of four leadership groups (Student Council, One Advocates, Class Leaders Committee, and CCA Leaders).
*   Tier 3: Very capable student leaders will be nominated to attend a Tier 3 leadership programme, which will prepare them to take on greater challenges beyond the school. Student leaders will also be provided with opportunities to apply their knowledge and skills.

**7 \.  What after-school engagement programmes are available in your school?**<br>Hua Yi offers a wide range of after-school engagement programmes to help students develop critical soft-skills such as:

*   Youth Venture (partnership with Lakeside Family Service Centre)
*   An 8-month adventure-themed based programme to develop and build character and resilience.
*   Habitudes (partnership with Halogen Foundation)
*   A programme to help students discover their strengths through powerful image-based learning.
*   Mindfulness (partnership with Brahm Centre)
*   A programme to teach students techniques to improve their ability to focus and regulation of emotions.
*   LEAD (partnership with CampVision)

Hangout @ Hua Yi is run by our school’s learning mentor, Mr Hilman, and is a vibrant space equipped with a variety of facilities and activities for students to engage in after school. Through his bubbly and endearing personality, Mr Hilman establishes a strong level of rapport with students and help inculcate in them stronger self-management skills. He is constantly innovating Hangout to make it ever more attractive for students to drop in.

**8 \.  Does your school offer overseas adventure camps?**<br>Hua Yi has engaging learning programmes customised for every level, which may include overseas trips, usually for the upper secondary students.
*   Sec 3 Level Programme to Batam
* *  On 27 February to 1 March 2019, the Secondary Three cohort went on an overseas experience to Batam as part of their Level Programme.
*  * The experience focused on 2 main areas:&nbsp;
-&gt; School and cultural involvement&nbsp;<br>
-&gt; Values in Action (VIA) projects at orphanages
    

  

Learning beyond the classroom serves as a way to challenge students to come out of their comfort zones, develop empathy and demonstrate team-building skills. Students also get to experience different cultures and learn to appreciate Singapore in the process.

**9 \.  House System**<br>This year, Hua Yi made a major change to the way the school was structured. The school adopted a house system, with the school and student body organised by their house (Altius, Citius, Diutius, Fortius, Latius) instead of level. Taking reference from the Olympic motto, each house espouses an Olympic ideal to inspire every student and staff to give their all in the pursuit of excellence. Headed by a House Master, guided by a House Discipline Master, managed by two House Managers, and led by two House Leaders from each class, every house is a unique ecosystem by itself! This organisational move helped to strengthen the camaraderie of students from different classes across levels. It also created opportunities for a stronger house spirit to shine through in each house, as many school activities and programmes leveraged the house system to promote a spirit of friendly competition.
