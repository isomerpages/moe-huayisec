<p><strong>2 . What is Hua Yi’s strategy for Blended Learning?</strong>
</p>
<p>Blended Learning in Hua Yi takes the form of ILD (Independent Learning
Day) every even Friday. There are 2 segments to each session:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Curriculum coverage within and outside school, which focuses on <strong>JOY</strong> -
Joy in learning, Ownership of Learning and Applying learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Student initiated learning called Project Sandbox where students will
get the opportunity to pursue interests of their choice such as Sports
and Fitness, Music, Art and Craft, Languages, Botany etc. The activities
can be pursued in school, at home, or other locations, with teachers acting
as mentors and co learners!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>3 . How will the Personal Device be implemented in Hua Yi?</strong>
</p>
<p>Every Hua Yian will be using the Apple iPad as their personal learning
device. Every iPad will come bundled with the Apple pencil and keyboard
to maximise the affordances of the iPad as a learning tool.</p>
<p>Not only is the iPad a portable device that offers students convenient
learning on-the-move, it also allows for a seamless learning experience
alongside existing learning technologies such as the Student Learning Space
(SLS) and Team Model Smarter Classroom System.&nbsp; For more information
on PDLP:</p>
<p><strong>4 . How will Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB) look like in Hua Yi?</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2021, we have integrated the Normal Academic and Normal Technical stream.
The integration of both streams is Hua Yi’s first step towards Full Subject-Based
Banding (FSBB) in 2022 as we celebrate the unique strengths and diversity
of our students.</p>
<p>(a) How does FSBB work?</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>FSBB is fully implemented in 2024, with the removal of the different streams.
All students will be grouped into mixed form classes, with the provision
of a common curriculum.
<br>Besides the common curriculum, students have the flexibility to take SBB
subjects at G1, G2 or G3 level.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Common Curriculum comprises the following subjects:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Art;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design &amp; Technology;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food and Consumer Education (FCE);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Music;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical Education (PE)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and the SBB subjects offered comprises the following subjects:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>English Language;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mother Tongue Languages;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mathematics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Science;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Geography;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>History;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Literature in English</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Does the school offer SBB?</strong>
</p>
<p>Hua Yi currently offers Subject-Based Banding (SBB) for English, Mother
Tongues, Mathematics, Science, Humanities subjects (Geography and History)
and Literature in English. Further information and details about SBB in
Hua Yi will be shared during the Secondary 1 Registration event in December.</p>
<p><strong>6. What is ALP and/ or LLP about?</strong>
</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of Hua Yi in terms of learning programmes and opportunities
given to students can be found in the brochure.</p>
<p><strong>ALP:</strong> Hua Yi’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) aims to
prepare our students for the challenges in this digital age.</p>
<p>The programme will nurture the Joy of Learning in students. Students will
work with their peers to generate solutions to real life problems and in
the process, their creativity, communication skills and confidence will
be developed.&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students will get the opportunity to apply what they learn in English
Language, Design &amp; Technology, ICT, Science and Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students will work on topics related to Health Science and Healthcare
Technologies.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on ALP:</p>
<p><strong>LLP:</strong> Hua Yi Secondary’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP)
focuses on Community Youth Leadership (CYL). The LLP aims to help students
develop life skills and values. Through this, students will discover their
strengths, interests and talents.&nbsp;CYL focuses on providing students
with opportunities to lead in serving the community and developing them
as leaders of empathy.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Tier 1: The students will learn about the Leadership Challenge Module
- Model the Way, Enable Others to Act, Encourage the Heart, Inspire a Shared
Vision and Challenge the Process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tier 2: Through selection, appointment and training, students are nurtured
to develop their leadership skills and they will be stretched to develop
their potential in one of eight leadership groups (Student Council, One
Advocates, Class Leaders Committee, CCA Leaders, ICT Champions, Environmental
Ambassadors, House Leaders and Peer Support Leaders).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tier 3: Very capable student leaders will be nominated to attend a Tier
3 leadership programme, which will prepare them to take on greater challenges
beyond the school. Student leaders will also be provided with opportunities
to apply their knowledge and skills.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on LLP:</p>
<p><strong>7. What after-school engagement programmes are available in your school?</strong>
</p>
<p>Hua Yi offers a wide range of after-school engagement programmes to help
students develop critical soft-skills such as:</p>
<p><strong>a) Mentoring Program by the GRIT Academy (TGA)</strong>A 6 to
9 month mentoring programme by the youth branch of the Lakeside Family
Services. Students undergo a journey of self-discovery through experential
activities supported by mentors and friends. <strong>b) The Discovery Program</strong>A
creative program to empower students with skills to enhance their self-awareness
and manage positive relationships with others. Students learn strategies
for self-management, coping skills and the activities help them to build
up their readiness and resilience. <strong>c) Youth Venture (partnership with Lakeside Family Service Centre)</strong>An
8-month adventure-themed based programme to develop and build character
and resilience. <strong>d) Student Support Programme</strong>Programmes
focus on behavioral, social emotional skills or meaningful holiday engagement.</p>
<p>Hangout @ Hua Yi is run by our school’s learning mentor. The venue is
a vibrant space equipped with a variety of facilities and activities for
students to engage in after school. The learning mentor establishes a strong
level of rapport with students and helps inculcate in them stronger self-management
skills. There are also constant innovations for Hangout to make it ever
more attractive for students to drop in.</p>
<p><strong>8 . House System</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2022, Hua Yi made a major change to the way the school was structured.
The school adopted a house system, with the school and student body organised
by their house (Altius, Citius, Diutius, Fortius, Latius) instead of level.
Taking reference from the Olympic motto, each house espouses an Olympic
ideal to inspire every student and staff to give their all in the pursuit
of excellence. Headed by a House Master, guided by a House Discipline Master,
managed by two House Managers, and led by two House Leaders from each class,
every house is a unique ecosystem by itself! This organisational move helped
to strengthen the camaraderie of students from different classes across
levels. It also created opportunities for a stronger house spirit to shine
through in each house, as many school activities and programmes leveraged
the house system to promote a spirit of friendly competition.</p>
<h4>HIGHER MOTHER TONGUE/ CLB/ THIRD LANGUAGE</h4>
<p><strong>1 . Can my child do&nbsp;HCL/ HML?</strong>Yes. If your child

result slips stating that they are eligible to read&nbsp;HCL/HML. If he/she
is not given this option form, it means that the child is not eligible.</p>
<p><strong>2 . If the child is not given the option form and is still interested to read HCL, they can apply in accordance to Hua Yi MTL policy for HCL:</strong>In
