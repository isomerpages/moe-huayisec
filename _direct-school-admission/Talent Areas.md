## Talent Areas

Hua Yi will be offering DSA places for the following talent areas:  

*   [Performing Arts]
*   [Physical Sports]
*   [Student Leadership]
*   [Visual Arts]

Each of these talent areas have been selected as they represent different aspects of our holistic Hua Yi curriculum that we offer. DSA students can expect to be immersed in a school culture that is rooted in our school values of benevolence, wisdom, justice and togetherness, and be developed on our core student outcomes based on our school mission. Hua Yi seeks to nurture our students to be creative, independent life-long learners who are confident, gracious, humble and responsible citizens, prepared for the challenges ahead.
