<h2>Uniformed Groups</h2>
<p>Visual Arts plays a significant role in our students’ holistic education
experience. At Hua Yi Secondary School, we aim to engage students in inquiry
and exploration, build students’ self-confidence and develop their creative
and artistic talents in Visual Arts. We offer different opportunities for
exposure to and platforms for participation in multiple and varied art
forms. This is achieved through an engaging and broad-based curriculum
encompassing assembly presentations, enrichment workshops as well as learning
journeys to various art showcases including the National Design Centre,
Art Museum as well as visits to other institutions of learning.</p>
