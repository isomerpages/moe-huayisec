<p>Each of these talent areas have been selected as they represent different
aspects of our holistic Hua Yi curriculum that we offer. DSA students can
expect to be immersed in a school culture that is rooted in our school
values of benevolence, wisdom, justice and togetherness, and be developed
on our core student outcomes based on our school mission. Hua Yi seeks
to nurture our students to be creative, independent life-long learners
who are confident, gracious, humble and responsible citizens, prepared
for the challenges ahead.</p>
