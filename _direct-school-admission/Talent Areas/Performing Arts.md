## Performing Arts

Aesthetics play a significant role in our studentsâ€™ holistic education experience. At Hua Yi Secondary School, we aim to nurture the diverse artistic and musical talents of our students; we provide different opportunities for exposure to and platforms for participation in multiple and varied art forms. Our rich heritage has enabled us to build strong partnerships and ties with our alumni and parents who contribute actively to the provision of a rich aesthetics education for all Hua Yians. These partnerships include combined training and performances such as the school.
