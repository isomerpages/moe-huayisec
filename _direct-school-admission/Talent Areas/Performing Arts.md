<h2>Performing Arts</h2>
<p>Aesthetics play a significant role in our studentsâ€™ holistic education
experience. At Hua Yi Secondary School, we aim to nurture the diverse artistic
and musical talents of our students; we provide different opportunities
for exposure to and platforms for participation in multiple and varied
art forms. Our rich heritage has enabled us to build strong partnerships
and ties with our alumni and parents who contribute actively to the provision
of a rich aesthetics education for all Hua Yians. These partnerships include
combined training and performances such as the school.</p>
