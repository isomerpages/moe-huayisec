<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>At Hua Yi Secondary School, we believe that all students have different
gifts and abilities to make a difference to society.</p>
<p>All students will be holistically developed, imbued with strong moral
values and acquire a strong foundation in the knowledge, skills and competencies
to overcome the challenges of a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous
(VUCA) world.</p>
<p>Hua Yians will be developed as:
<br>a. Passionate Learners who take responsibility and are motivated life-long
learners.
<br>b. Resilient Leaders who are courageous and make difficult decisions in
the best interests of all
<br>c. Empathetic Contributors who willingly step forward to help others and
make a difference.
<br>d. Glocalised Citizens who understand contemporary trends and issues,
staying rooted to Singapore and relevant to the world.</p>
<p>Hua Yi welcomes prospective students with passion and talents from various
fields, representing the different aspects of our holistic curriculum,
to join the Hua Yi family through the Direct School Admission-Secondary
(DSA-Sec) Exercise.</p>
