## FAQ

**1 \. What is DSA-Sec?**  
DSA-Sec is an admission exercise to allow participating schools to select some Primary Six students for admission to Secondary One based on their achievements and talents before the PSLE results are released.  
  
For students, the DSA-Sec Exercise provides them the opportunity to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents when seeking admission to secondary schools.  
  
Students successfully allocated to a school through the DSA-Sec will not be allowed to participate in the Secondary 1 (S1) Posting to opt for secondary schools or to transfer to another school after the release of the PSLE results. Students who are not ready to commit to studying in a particular school to develop their chosen talent areas may wish to consider the S1 Posting instead, in which students are admitted based on their PSLE scores.

**2 \. What is the DSA process in 2022?**  
The selection exercise will be conducted in person with shortlisted students in the DSA-Sec school. The session may consist of interview components and/or performance tasks (e.g. demonstration of skills such as the applicantâ€™s individual movement ability for Sports, or performances of voice, dance and/or instruments for Performing Arts).  
  
For shortlisted students, the DSA-Sec school may request for the submission of additional documents such as: (i) existing portfolios (e.g. Art e-portfolios comprising works done in school Art lesson/Art CCA); or (ii) write-ups (e.g. personal statement, short essay), or CCA/VIA record.
