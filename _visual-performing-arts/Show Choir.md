<p>Hua Yi Show Choir is made up of a talented and passionate group of members
who have a strong interest in singing and dancing, similar to what you
would see in contemporary music videos. Show Choir provides opportunities
for students to develop 21st Century Competencies, including self-awareness
and relationship management through working on their teamwork and confidence
to express themselves. Students also get to make a difference in the community
by sharing their talents during Values-in-Action activities.</p>
