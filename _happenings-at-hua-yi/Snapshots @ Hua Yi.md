#### Spreading Grains of Love

Our Badminton girls, Singapore Youth Flying Club (SYFC) members, Track & Field team and student leaders from the Student Council were busy spreading grains of love to their Jurong neighbours over the weekend.

United as one, the different student groups took turns in the morning and afternoon to deliver rice packs to households in Jurong Central, ri(ce)ing up to the occasion to give back to the community. Way to go, Hua Yians!

#### Project Love

Project Love is an annual project, in partnership with the Jurong Central Zone 'B' Residents' Committee.

Our Advisor to Jurong GRC Grassroots Organisations (Jurong Central), Mr Xie Yao Quan, joined the Floorball team and HYSS staff to distribute the nicely decorated hampers and gifts to households in our Jurong community.
