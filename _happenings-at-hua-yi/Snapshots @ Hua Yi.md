## Snapshots @ Hua Yi

#### Spreading Grains of Love

Our Badminton girls, Singapore Youth Flying Club (SYFC) members, Track & Field team and student leaders from the Student Council were busy spreading grains of love to their Jurong neighbours over the weekend.

United as one, the different student groups took turns in the morning and afternoon to deliver rice packs to households in Jurong Central, ri(ce)ing up to the occasion to give back to the community. Way to go, Hua Yians!
