## Introduction

At Hua Yi Secondary School, we believe that all students have different gifts and abilities to make a difference to society.  
  
All students will be holistically developed, imbued with strong moral values and acquire a strong foundation in the knowledge, skills and competencies to overcome the challenges of a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) world.  
  
Hua Yians will be developed as: <br>
a.  Passionate Learners who take responsibility and are motivated life-long learners.<br>
b.  Resilient Leaders who are courageous and make difficult decisions in the best interests of all<br>
c.  Empathetic Contributors who willingly step forward to help others and make a difference.<br>
d.  Glocalised Citizens who understand contemporary trends and issues, staying rooted to Singapore and relevant to the world.

Hua Yi welcomes prospective students with passion and talents from various fields, representing the different aspects of our holistic curriculum, to join the Hua Yi family through the Direct School Admission-Secondary (DSA-Sec) Exercise.

**Personal Reflections:**  
  
I decided to choose Hua Yi as my DSA School because of several reasons. The first is that I have heard from my (Xingnan Primary) seniors that Hua Yi is a school that emphasizes academics and has good overall discipline. Students are given many opportunities to learn and grow through various school programmes. In addition, the teachers are very understanding and are always willing to provide support whenever needed. Hence, I feel that Hua Yi has a very caring and supportive school environment.  
  
Secondly, Hua Yi’s volleyball team has a good track record in both zonal and national competitions. Through conversations with my seniors in Hua Yi and the volleyball coach, I was convinced that the training culture and developmental opportunities were suited for me. Now, as a Secondary Four student, I have come to the realisation that opportunities in Hua Yi have helped me build a positive mindset in face of the different challenges over the years.
