## Netball

<img src="/images/CCA-12.jpg" style="width:85%">

Our Netball CCA aims to ignite students’ passion in the sport and build lifelong friendships among the players. Training to reach match fitness and peak performance, students learn and apply their skills, techniques and strategies in attack and defence. Through exposure to activities in the local netball scene, the players develop sportsmanship on and off the court.
