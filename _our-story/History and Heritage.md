## History and Heritage

Before its independence in 1965, Singapore was a British colony. Britain surrendered Singapore to the Japanese during World War II, who inflicted many atrocities on the people of Singapore, particularly the Chinese, during their occupation, e.g. the Sook Ching massacre. This caused underlying anti-colonial sentiment and resentment among the people, when the British returned to govern after the Japanese Occupation. In 1949, the founding of the People's Republic of China also spurred many Chinese-educated students to join&nbsp; the anti-colonial movement.

**10 October**<br>
Radicalised students from Chung Cheng High School (CCHS) and Chinese High School (CHS) go on strike and occupy their campuses to protest the British colonial government’s dissolution of the Singapore Chinese Middle School Students’ Union (SCMSSU) and the arrests of student leaders and trade union leaders.

**12 October**<br>
The sit-in persists and the government subsequently closes the two Chinese schools. It orders students who were not involved and wished to continue their studies to register on 13 and 14 October for re-assignment to newly established government Chinese middle schools (GCMS).

**16 October**<br>
First two GCMSs commence classes. These were Hua Yi (华义政府华文中学) and Kallang West (later renamed Dunman) GCMS. A third school, Gan Eng Seng (later renamed Thomson) GCMS is set up in November. Hua Yi’s initial student cohort comprised transfers from CCHS.

These three government-run Chinese middle schools provide education from the secondary to pre-university level and are established to prevent student unrest. This also marks the beginning of a new era in Singapore’s education, as prior to this, Chinese middle schools were established by the Chinese community to promote culture and retain heritage.  

Hua Yi is initially set up in an English primary school at Fowlie Road, with more than 40 staff and 578 students.<br clear="left"><br><br>

Over the past 60 years, since it first started in 1956, Hua Yi Secondary School (HYSS) has seen five different campuses, with improving facilities and a wealth of historical information. HYSS aims to cultivate and nurture subsequent generations of Hua Yians to be lifelong learners, responsible citizens and having a sense of pride in its rich history and heritage, especially in its original Chinese roots, and to live up to the name of “Hua Yi”.
