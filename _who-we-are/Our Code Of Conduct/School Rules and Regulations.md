A conduct grade of ‘Fair’ and ‘Poor’ at the end of the year will affect a student’s eligibility for MOE Edusave awards.

|:---:|---|---|---|
| Excellent | Minimum 95% | Minimum 95% | 80 and above |
| Very Good | Minimum 95% | Minimum 90% | 75 – 79 |
|Good  | Minimum 85% | Minimum 75% | 65 – 74 |
| Fair | 75 – 84% | 50 – 74% | 55 – 64 |

##### School & CCA Attendance

Attendance and punctuality for school and CCA is essential to a student’s learning and character development.

Similarly, CCA attendance includes % days a student attends CCA punctually and absence from CCA for medical reasons and supported with a valid M.C..

Late-coming or absence from school or CCA that is not supported with a valid M.C. will lead to lower conduct grades being awarded.
