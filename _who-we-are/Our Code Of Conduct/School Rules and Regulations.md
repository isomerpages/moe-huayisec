##### Absence from School

1 \.  A student who is absent due to sickness must submit the original medical certificate (M.C.) from a certified doctor to the Form Teacher on the day he/she returns to school. The school should be informed via telephone on the day of absence by 7.30am.  

2 \.  Medical certificates from non-MOH registered clinics (e.g. Chinese medical halls, homeopathy clinics) will not be accepted.  
      
3 \.  For non-medical reasons (such as a bereavement in the family), a letter from the parent/guardian should be produced. Such a letter should be neatly written or typed and enclosed in an envelope. Students should not submit more than five letters from parent/guardian per semester.  
        
4 \.  The following reasons for absences are strongly discouraged:  
      
*   Going on overseas trips or holidays during curriculum time

Students who may be absent due to any of the above reasons should consult the school at least two weeks in advance.  
  
5 \.  Absence without a medical certificate or a parent/guardian’s letter may be regarded as a truancy case.  

6 \.  School attendance is a component in the assessment of a student’s conduct grade (refer to “Conduct Grading” section).  

7 \.  Letters from a parent/guardian will be considered on a case-by-case basis in determining whether an absent student can re-sit for weighted assessments that they missed.  

8 \.  Students who are absent for summative reviews will not be allowed to re-sit for the paper. Students who are absent without M.C. for a summative review will be awarded a zero mark.
