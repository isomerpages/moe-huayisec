## House System

There are currently five Houses in Hua Yi Secondary School. Inspired by the Youth Olympic Games back in 2009, the five Houses are Altius (higher), Citius (faster), Diutius (longer), Fortius (stronger) and Latius (wider). The House system aims to give students an identity placed within the school, and a sense of pride in a supportive and secure environment. The&nbsp;[House activities](https://staging.d24qp50d0iaegk.amplifyapp.com/the-huayi-experience/hp/)&nbsp;are designed to reflect and enhance the fulfilment of the Hua Yi student outcomes of being passionate learners, empathetic contributors, resilient leaders and glocalised citizens.

In 2020, the fifth House named Latius (Latin for ‘wider’) was added as Hua Yi began the process of integrating classes into the House system. 2020 also marked a new cycle of House identity building for all five Houses where students and their teachers set out to create new symbols, mottos and cheers that best represent their House community.  

Embodying the Olympic values, the five Houses with their new symbols and mottos are shown below:

Now in 2021, every class from Secondary 1 to 5 is associated with one of the five Houses. Sporting new House T-shirts and fresh from the previous year of identity building, Hua Yi students and staff are ready to embark on an exciting new journey of inter-house activities with purpose.
