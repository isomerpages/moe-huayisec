<h2>House System</h2>
<p>There are currently five Houses in Hua Yi Secondary School. Inspired by
the Youth Olympic Games back in 2009, the five Houses are Altius (higher),
Citius (faster), Diutius (longer), Fortius (stronger) and Latius (wider).
The House system aims to give students an identity placed within the school,
and a sense of pride in a supportive and secure environment. The&nbsp;
<a href="https://staging.d24qp50d0iaegk.amplifyapp.com/the-huayi-experience/hp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">House activities</a>&nbsp;are designed to reflect and enhance the fulfilment
of the Hua Yi student outcomes of being passionate learners, empathetic
contributors, resilient leaders and glocalised citizens.</p>
<p>In 2020, the fifth House named Latius (Latin for ‘wider’) was added as
Hua Yi began the process of integrating classes into the House system.
2020 also marked a new cycle of House identity building for all five Houses
where students and their teachers set out to create new symbols, mottos
and cheers that best represent their House community.</p>
<p>Now, every class from Secondary 1 to 5 is associated with one of the five
Houses.</p>
<p>Embodying the Olympic values, the five Houses with their new symbols and
mottos are shown below:</p>
