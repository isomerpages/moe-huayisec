<h2>School Rules and Regulations</h2>
<p>The following rules and regulations have been crafted to help students
develop self-discipline and to imbibe a sense of accountability to self
and others in the school and community.</p>
<h4>A. Attendance</h4>
<h5>Flag-raising and Pledge-taking Ceremony</h5>
<p>1. Students should be ready at the assembly point for the flag-raising
ceremony which commences at 7.30 a.m. sharp. Attendance will be taken at
the assembly point.</p>
<p>2. Students who are Singapore Citizens must sing the National Anthem and
take the Pledge. Students will take the Pledge with the right fist over
the heart.</p>
<p>3. Students in the vicinity of the ceremony are to stand at attention
and face the National flag.</p>
<h5>Punctuality for School</h5>
<p>1 . A student is considered late when he/she is not at the assembly point
on time to attend the flag-raising and pledge-taking ceremony.</p>
<p>2. Latecomers will be required to take their attendance near to Security
Guardhouse.</p>
<p>3. Latecomers must be attired in school uniform when entering the school.
The top must be neatly tucked in.</p>
<p>4. No extra time will be given for students who turn up late for tests
or examinations.</p>
<p>5. Punctuality for school is a component in the assessment of a student’s
conduct grade (refer to Conduct Grading section).</p>
<h5>Absence from School</h5>
<p>1. Students who are absent due to illness must submit the original medical
certificate (MC) issued by a registered medical practitioner to their Form
Teacher on the day they return to school. Parents/guardians are required
to inform the school of the student’s absence via telephone by 7.30 a.m.
on the day of absence.</p>
<p>2. Medical certificates from non-MOH registered clinics (Chinese medical
halls/ homeopathy clinics etc.) will not be accepted.</p>
<p>3. For non-medical reasons (such as a bereavement in the family), a letter
from the parent/guardian should be produced. Such a letter should be neatly
written or typed and enclosed in an envelope. Students should not submit
more than five letters from parent/guardian per semester.</p>
<p>4. The following reasons for absences are strongly discouraged:</p>
<p>a. Going on overseas trips or holidays during curriculum time</p>
<p>b. Engaging in unofficial activities during school hours</p>
<p>c. Allowing a child to be absent from school to study at home</p>
<p>Students who may be absent due to any of the above reasons should seek
permission from the school at least two weeks in advance.</p>
<p>5. Absence without a valid M.C. or a parent’s/guardian’s letter may be
regarded as a truancy case.</p>
<p>6. School attendance is a component in the assessment of a student’s conduct
grade (refer to Conduct Grading section).</p>
<p>7. Students must produce a valid MC to be eligible to sit for a make-up
weighted assessment (WA) or to be considered for special considerations.
Letters from parents/guardians will be considered on a case-by-case basis
when determining whether an absent student may take the make-up assessment.</p>
<p>8. There will be no make-up paper for students who miss Coordinated WA2,
the Preliminary Examination, or the Summative Review. Students who are
absent without a valid MC for the Summative Review will be awarded zero
mark.</p>

<h5>School &amp; CCA Attendance</h5>

school punctually, and absence from school for medical reasons and supported
with a valid M.C..</p>
<p>Similarly, CCA attendance includes % days a student attends CCA punctually
and absence from CCA for medical reasons and supported with a valid M.C..</p>
<p>Late-coming or absence from school or CCA that is not supported with a
valid M.C. will lead to lower conduct grades being awarded.</p>
<h4>Merit &amp; Demerit System</h4>
<p>Every student begins each year with a benchmark of 75 points, which is
equivalent to a “Very Good” conduct grade. Merit points will raise the
benchmark and demerit points will reduce it. Every teacher can award merit
and demerit points to deserving students.</p>
<h5>Merit Points</h5>
<p>Students can be awarded merit points for good behaviour or socially responsible
acts such as those specified below:</p>
