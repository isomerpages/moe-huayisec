<h2>School Rules and Regulations</h2>
<p>The following rules and regulations have been crafted to help students
develop self-discipline and to imbibe a sense of accountability to self
and others in the school and community.</p>
<h4>Attendance</h4>
<h5>Flag-raising and Pledge-taking Ceremony</h5>
<p>1 . Students should arrive in school by 7.30am/7.45am in accordance with
the timetable and be ready at the assembly point for the flag-raising ceremony,
which commences at 7.45am sharp. Attendance will be taken at the assembly
point.</p>
<p>2 . Students who are Singapore citizens must sing the National Anthem
and take the Pledge. Pupils will take the Pledge with the right fist over
the heart.</p>
<p>3 . Students in the vicinity of the ceremony are to stand at attention
and face the National Flag.</p>
<h5>Punctuality for School</h5>
<p>1 . A student is considered late when he/she is not able to arrive at

Sports Hall.</p>
<p>3 . Latecomers must be attired in school uniform when entering the school.</p>

certificate (M.C.) from a certified doctor to the Form Teacher on the day

<p>2 . Medical certificates from non-MOH registered clinics (e.g. Chinese
medical halls, homeopathy clinics) will not be accepted.</p>
<p>3 . For non-medical reasons (such as a bereavement in the family), a letter
from the parent/guardian should be produced. Such a letter should be neatly
written or typed and enclosed in an envelope. Students should not submit

</li>
</ul>
<p>Students who may be absent due to any of the above reasons should consult
the school at least two weeks in advance.</p>

may be regarded as a truancy case.</p>
<p>6 . School attendance is a component in the assessment of a student’s
conduct grade (refer to “Conduct Grading” section).</p>
<p>7 . Letters from a parent/guardian will be considered on a case-by-case
basis in determining whether an absent student can re-sit for weighted
assessments that they missed.</p>

to re-sit for the paper. Students who are absent without M.C. for a summative
review will be awarded a zero mark.</p>

<h5>School &amp; CCA Attendance</h5>
<p>Attendance and punctuality for school and CCA is essential to a student’s
learning and character development.</p>
<p>For conduct grading, school attendance includes % days a student attends
school punctually, and absence from school for medical reasons and supported
with a valid M.C..</p>
<p>Similarly, CCA attendance includes % days a student attends CCA punctually
and absence from CCA for medical reasons and supported with a valid M.C..</p>
<p>Late-coming or absence from school or CCA that is not supported with a
valid M.C. will lead to lower conduct grades being awarded.</p>
<h4>Merit &amp; Demerit System</h4>
<p>Every student begins each year with a benchmark of 75 points, which is
equivalent to a “Very Good” conduct grade. Merit points will raise the
benchmark and demerit points will reduce it. Every teacher can award merit
and demerit points to deserving students.</p>
<h5>Merit Points</h5>
<p>Students can be awarded merit points for good behaviour or socially responsible
acts such as those specified below:</p>
