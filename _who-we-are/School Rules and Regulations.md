<h2>School Rules and Regulations</h2>
<p>The following rules and regulations have been crafted to help students
develop self-discipline and to imbibe a sense of accountability to self
and others in the school and community.</p>
<h4>A. Attendance</h4>
<h5><u>Flag-raising and Pledge-taking Ceremony</u></h5>
<p>1. Students should be ready at the assembly point for the flag-raising
ceremony which commences at 7.30 a.m. sharp. Attendance will be taken at
the assembly point.</p>
<p>2. Students who are Singapore Citizens must sing the National Anthem and
take the Pledge. Students will take the Pledge with the right fist over
the heart.</p>
<p>3. Students in the vicinity of the ceremony are to stand at attention
and face the National flag.</p>
<h5><u>Punctuality for School</u></h5>
<p>1 . A student is considered late when he/she is not at the assembly point
on time to attend the flag-raising and pledge-taking ceremony.</p>
<p>2. Latecomers will be required to take their attendance near to Security
Guardhouse.</p>
<p>3. Latecomers must be attired in school uniform when entering the school.
The top must be neatly tucked in.</p>
<p>4. No extra time will be given for students who turn up late for tests
or examinations.</p>
<p>5. Punctuality for school is a component in the assessment of a student’s
conduct grade (refer to Conduct Grading section).</p>
<h5><u>Absence from School</u></h5>
<p>1. Students who are absent due to illness must submit the original medical
certificate (MC) issued by a registered medical practitioner to their Form
Teacher on the day they return to school. Parents/guardians are required
to inform the school of the student’s absence via telephone by 7.30 a.m.
on the day of absence.</p>
<p>2. Medical certificates from non-MOH registered clinics (Chinese medical
halls/ homeopathy clinics etc.) will not be accepted.</p>
<p>3. For non-medical reasons (such as a bereavement in the family), a letter
from the parent/guardian should be produced. Such a letter should be neatly
written or typed and enclosed in an envelope. Students should not submit
more than five letters from parent/guardian per semester.</p>
<p>4. The following reasons for absences are strongly discouraged:</p>
<p>a. Going on overseas trips or holidays during curriculum time</p>
<p>b. Engaging in unofficial activities during school hours</p>
<p>c. Allowing a child to be absent from school to study at home</p>
<p>Students who may be absent due to any of the above reasons should seek
permission from the school at least two weeks in advance.</p>
<p>5. Absence without a valid M.C. or a parent’s/guardian’s letter may be
regarded as a truancy case.</p>
<p>6. School attendance is a component in the assessment of a student’s conduct
grade (refer to Conduct Grading section).</p>
<p>7. Students must produce a valid MC to be eligible to sit for a make-up
weighted assessment (WA) or to be considered for special considerations.
Letters from parents/guardians will be considered on a case-by-case basis
when determining whether an absent student may take the make-up assessment.</p>
<p>8. There will be no make-up paper for students who miss Coordinated WA2,
the Preliminary Examination, or the Summative Review. Students who are
absent without a valid MC for the Summative Review will be awarded zero
mark.</p>
<h4>B. Movement</h4>
<h5><u>Leaving class during lessons</u></h5>
<p>1. If the need arises, a student can leave the class after obtaining the
teacher’s permission.</p>
<p>2. A student who does not need to attend any lesson during curriculum
time should engage in self-study during his/her free periods at study areas
such as Library.</p>
<h5><u>Movement between lessons</u></h5>
<p>1. Students should line up in two rows and walk in a brisk and orderly
manner to the venue for the next lesson. Students must bring all necessary
resources for their lessons and should not return to their classrooms to
retrieve any materials. Students are not allowed to detour to other areas
of the school without first obtaining permission from the teacher of the
next lesson.</p>
<h5><u>Leaving school premises during school hours</u></h5>
<p>1. A student must inform his/her Form Teacher if he/she needs to leave
the school premises during school hours.</p>
<p>2. A parent/guardian should accompany a student home after registering
with the General Office.</p>

<h4><strong>F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physical Education Lessons</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2026/PE_Uniform_2026.jpg">
</div>
<p>1. The attire for Physical Education lessons is the school PE T-shirt
and black shorts with the letters “HYSS” embroidered in red. The PE T-shirt
must be neatly tucked in at all times.</p>
<p>2. CCA attire (e.g., jerseys and team shorts) must not be worn during
PE lessons. Recalcitrant students who fail to wear the stipulated PE attire
will be dealt with according to school rules.</p>
<p>3. Students are to change into their PE attire only during their PE period.</p>
<p>Students who have PE lessons before their break must change back into
their school uniform by the end of the break.</p>
<p>4. Students who are exempted from physical activities or are physically
unfit to participate in PE lessons must present a valid medical certificate
(MC) to the PE teachers. PE teachers may assign light duties such as timekeeper,
recorder, or equipment assistant, and students may also be advised to bring
reading materials.</p>
<p>5. Students who are unwell without an MC must still change into their
PE attire and report for the lesson. They may be exempted from physical
activity at the teacher’s discretion.</p>
<p>6. All students are encouraged to deposit their valuables with their PE
teachers at the start of the lesson. Valuables will be returned at the
end of the lesson.</p>
<p>7. Students who wish to borrow PE equipment must exchange their student
pass for the item. The pass will be returned upon the return of the equipment.</p>
<p>8. Students will be given at least one water break during each PE lesson.
Water breaks will be provided after 20–25 minutes, depending on the intensity
of the activities.</p>
<h4><strong>CONDUCT GRADING</strong></h4>
<p>At the end of each semester, students will be awarded a Conduct Grade,
which reflects their conduct and behaviour.</p>
<p>The Conduct Grade is determined based on a student’s attendance for school
and Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), as well as records under the Merit
and Demerit System (MDS).</p>
<p>Students who receive a Conduct Grade of ‘Fair’ or ‘Poor’ at the end of
the year will have their eligibility for MOE Edusave awards affected. Students
with a ‘Fair’ or ‘Poor’ Conduct Grade may also be disallowed from representing
the school in the National School Games or in internationalisation trips.</p>

<h4><strong>SCHOOL AND CCA ATTENDANCE</strong></h4>
<p>Regular attendance and punctuality for both school and Co-Curricular Activities
(CCA) are essential to a student’s learning and character development.</p>
<p>For conduct grading, school attendance includes the percentage of days
the student attends school punctually, as well as absences supported by
a valid medical certificate (MC).</p>
<p>Similarly, CCA attendance includes the percentage of sessions the student
attends punctually, and absences supported by a valid MC.</p>
<p>Late-coming or absence from school or CCA without a valid medical certificate
will adversely affect the student’s Conduct Grade.</p>
<h4><strong>MERIT AND DEMERIT SYSTEM</strong></h4>
<p>Every student begins each year with a benchmark of 75 points, which is
equivalent to a “Very Good” conduct grade. Merit points will raise the
benchmark and demerit points will reduce it. Every teacher can award merit
and demerit points to deserving students.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Merit points</u></strong></h4>
<p>Students can be awarded merit points for good behaviour or socially-responsible
acts such as those specified below:</p>
