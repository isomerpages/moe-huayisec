<h2>Student Outcomes</h2>
<p>In Hua Yi, Student Development is built upon the belief that all students
are unpolished gems who have different gifts and abilities. All can learn
and grow, have the potential to excel, and eventually, will make a difference
in society. These beliefs guide the school in the design and implementation
of programmes aimed towards developing Hua Yians to be:</p>
