<h2>History and Heritage</h2>
<p>Before its independence in 1965, Singapore was a British colony. Britain
surrendered Singapore to the Japanese during World War II, who inflicted
many atrocities on the people of Singapore, particularly the Chinese, during
their occupation, e.g. the Sook Ching massacre. This caused underlying
anti-colonial sentiment and resentment among the people, when the British
returned to govern after the Japanese Occupation. In 1949, the founding
of the People's Republic of China also spurred many Chinese-educated students
to join&nbsp; the anti-colonial movement.</p>

<p><strong>10 October</strong>
<br>Radicalised students from Chung Cheng High School (CCHS) and Chinese High
School (CHS) go on strike and occupy their campuses to protest the British
colonial government’s dissolution of the Singapore Chinese Middle School
Students’ Union (SCMSSU) and the arrests of student leaders and trade union
leaders.</p>
<p><strong>12 October</strong>
<br>The sit-in persists and the government subsequently closes the two Chinese
schools. It orders students who were not involved and wished to continue
their studies to register on 13 and 14 October for re-assignment to newly
established government Chinese middle schools (GCMS).</p>

<p><strong>16 October</strong>
<br>First two GCMSs commence classes. These were Hua Yi (华义政府华文中学) and Kallang
West (later renamed Dunman) GCMS. A third school, Gan Eng Seng (later renamed
Thomson) GCMS is set up in November. Hua Yi’s initial student cohort comprised
transfers from CCHS.</p>
<p>These three government-run Chinese middle schools provide education from
the secondary to pre-university level and are established to prevent student
unrest. This also marks the beginning of a new era in Singapore’s education,
as prior to this, Chinese middle schools were established by the Chinese
community to promote culture and retain heritage.</p>
<p>Hua Yi is initially set up in an English primary school at Fowlie Road,
with more than 40 staff and 578 students.

<p>Over the past 60 years, since it first started in 1956, Hua Yi Secondary
School (HYSS) has seen five different campuses, with improving facilities
and a wealth of historical information. HYSS aims to cultivate and nurture
subsequent generations of Hua Yians to be lifelong learners, responsible
citizens and having a sense of pride in its rich history and heritage,
especially in its original Chinese roots, and to live up to the name of
“Hua Yi”.</p>
