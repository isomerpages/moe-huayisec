## Principal's Message

<img src="/images/prinmsg.jpeg" style="width:85%">

Hello Everyone and a Happy 2023!

  

2018: Venture-step by step<br>
2019: Passion made Possible<br>
2020: Purpose, Action, Endless Possibility<br>
2021: Step Up, Step Out, Step Forward<br>
2022: Keep on Keeping On!

  

These have been our themes over the last few years. Our focus thus far has been to exhort Hua Yians to be bold and pursue their passions, to realise that if they have their goals in mind, if purposeful action is taken, if they have the courage to step forward, and persevere despite difficulties, the possibilities are endless.

Our theme for 2023 is: “We’re MAD”. Perhaps some people will think we are as we do things quite differently in Hua Yi, but that should not stop us from “**M**aking&nbsp;**A**&nbsp;**D**ifference!”. After opportunities have been given, after values have been inculcated, after skills and knowledge have been acquired, our expectation is for Hua Yians to impact the community, to make a difference to others.

What are some of the key activities and programmes that have been planned for this year? Most of the whole-school, House and Level Programmes will remain, beginning with the Start-It-Right Programme. Likewise, our fortnightly Independent Learning Day (ILD, for short), which takes place every even Friday will continue. The school’s flagship Learning Festival, conducted at the end of Semesters 1 &amp; 2, will also be carried out. However, there will be some tweaks and adjustments made, either to the activities, the structure of the programme, or in the way the programme is conducted.

This year we will be holding Montage and it will be an original musical performed by Hua Yians. Work on this already began at the end of 2022, and we’re looking forward to watch the performance in July at an external venue, namely the Canadian International School.

Some adjustments will be made in the way we manage some of the day-to-day processes. For example, to develop our students into responsible, independent learners who are able to exercise self-discipline and manage their time constructively, we have made the decision not to send in relief when teachers are on medical leave, attending a workshop or when there is whitespace in the timetable. The students will complete assigned tasks on their own. We believe that with guidance and clear expectations being set, our students will be able to rise up to the occasion, exercise autonomy and make good use of their time.

Indeed, it is our firm belief the many learning experiences that our students go through in Hua Yi, will enable them to develop their potential, inculcate in them the right values, and ultimately stead them in good stead for the future.

I wish everyone a joyous and meaningful 2023.&nbsp;
