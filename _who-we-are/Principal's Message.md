<h4><strong>Welcome to Hua Yi Secondary School!</strong></h4>
<p>It is my privilege to introduce Hua Yi Secondary School to you. Hua Yi
is a vibrant institution with a proud heritage of nurturing generations
of students to live by strong values, discover their talents, and contribute
meaningfully to society. Over the years, Hua Yi has grown into a school
where tradition meets innovation, and I am honored to continue building
on the solid foundation laid by my predecessors.</p>
<p>As we embrace 2025, our school theme, <em>“Voices that Care,”</em> underscores
our commitment to fostering a culture where every student feels encouraged
to speak confidently, responsibly and respectfully. This theme inspires
our students to care for others, act with empathy, and use their voices
to build bridges and make meaningful, positive differences in the world
around them.</p>
<p>Our vision—<em>“Inculcate Values, Inspire Talents, Impact Communities”</em>—guides
all that we do. At Hua Yi, we are dedicated to nurturing passionate learners,
resilient leaders, empathetic contributors, and global-minded citizens.
Through our holistic curriculum, students thrive academically while developing
strong character, leadership skills, and 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies
to succeed in a dynamic world.</p>
<p>Hua Yi’s vibrant school culture is anchored in our core values: 仁, 义,
智, 群 (Benevolence, Justice, Wisdom, Togetherness). These timeless principles
shape Hua Yians into individuals of integrity, compassion, and purpose,
equipping them with the dispositions to navigate life’s complexities with
confidence and care.</p>
<p>Our strength as a school community is amplified by the unwavering support
of the Hua Yi Alumni Society, School Advisory Board, and Parents Support
Group. These partners enrich the Hua Yi experience, providing invaluable
guidance, resources, and opportunities that empower our students to excel.</p>
<p>As we move forward, we remain steadfast in our mission to nurture future-ready
individuals who are anchored in values and committed to making a meaningful
impact. Guided by the spirit of <em>“Voices that Care,”</em> I am confident
that every Hua Yian will grow into a leader who inspires change and uplifts
others.</p>
<p>Let’s work together to make this journey meaningful and impactful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Warm Regards,</p>
<p>Dr Lim Siew Yee</p>
<p>Principal, Hua Yi Secondary School</p>
