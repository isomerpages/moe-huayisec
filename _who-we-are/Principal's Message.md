<p><strong>Welcome to Hua Yi Secondary School!</strong>
</p>
<p>It is my privilege and pleasure to welcome you to Hua Yi Secondary School,
a school with a proud heritage that has nurtured generations of students
to embody strong values, develop their talents, and contribute meaningfully
to society. Over the years, Hua Yi has grown into a vibrant institution
where tradition blends seamlessly with innovation. I am deeply appreciative
of the opportunity to be part of this journey and to build on the steadfast
efforts of my predecessors, whose leadership and dedication have laid the
foundation for our continued success.</p>
<p>As we embark on 2025, I am excited to introduce our school theme, <strong>"Voices that Care."</strong> This
theme reflects our commitment to cultivating a culture where every student
is encouraged to speak up and express themselves confidently. More importantly,
we aim to instill in our students the ability to do so with voices that
are caring, responsible, and constructive—voices that inspire, build bridges
and make a meaningful difference in the lives of others.</p>
<p>At Hua Yi, our vision to <strong>“Inculcate Values, Inspire Talents, and Impact Communities”</strong> drives
everything we do. We believe in nurturing every student to grow into <strong>a passionate learner, a resilient leader, an empathetic contributor, and a glocalized citizen</strong>.
These are individuals who are firmly grounded in strong values, equipped
with 21st-century skills, and prepared to make a positive impact both locally
and globally. Our holistic curriculum is designed to provide students with
opportunities to excel academically while also fostering their character
development and leadership capabilities.</p>
<p>Hua Yi’s vibrant culture is anchored in our core values of <strong>仁, 义, 智, 群 (<em>Benevolence, Justice, Wisdom, Togetherness</em>)</strong>.
These values have guided generations of Hua Yians, shaping them into individuals
of integrity, purpose, and compassion. They remain central to our mission
of preparing students to navigate the complexities of an ever-changing
world with confidence and care.</p>
<p>The strength of the Hua Yi community is also deeply rooted in the steadfast
support of our <strong>Hua Yi Alumni Society, School Advisory Board and Parents Support Group.</strong> These
dedicated partners enrich the school in countless ways—through their guidance,
resources, and initiatives that provide invaluable opportunities for our
students.</p>
<p>As Hua Yi continues to grow, we remain steadfast in our mission to shape
future-ready individuals who are anchored in values and ready to contribute
meaningfully to the world. Guided by the theme "Voices that Care," we look
forward to empowering every Hua Yian to lead with purpose and make a difference
in the lives of others.</p>
