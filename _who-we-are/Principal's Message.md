<p>At Hua Yi, we take pride in being a caring school and a future-ready community
where every student is known, valued, and given the opportunity to learn,
lead, and grow. In 2026, Hua Yi will celebrate a major milestone — our
70th Anniversary. Our theme, “<em>Our Legacy, Our Voice, Our Future</em>,”
honours our proud heritage as one of Singapore’s earliest government-established
Chinese secondary schools.</p>

<p>It also reaffirms our mission to nurture Hua Yians who live out our school
values — <strong>仁 (benevolence), 义 (justice), 智 (wisdom), 群 (togetherness)</strong>.
We want every Hua Yian to be confident in using their voice and ready to
shape a better future for themselves and others.</p>
<p>Our legacy is one of resilience, care, and progress. As we commemorate
this special year, we also look ahead, building on the strong foundation
laid by generations of dedicated staff, students, and alumni.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Student Voice and a Culture of Care</strong>
</p>
<p>At Hua Yi, we believe every student’s voice matters.
<br>We create authentic opportunities for students to lead, share their ideas,
and make a difference, through class and CCA projects, House events, and
student leadership initiatives.</p>
<p>This culture of voice is deeply rooted in care. Our teachers guide, mentor,
and empower students to take ownership of their learning and actions. We
trust our students to lead with empathy and integrity, and to understand
that true leadership begins with care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Future-Ready Hua Yians</strong>
</p>
<p>To be future-ready is to stay curious, adaptable, and anchored in strong
values. Guided by our vision — <strong><em>Inculcate Values, Inspire Talents, Impact Communities</em></strong> —
we nurture <strong>Passionate Learners, Resilient Leaders, Empathetic Contributors, and Glocalised Citizens</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As an Apple Distinguished School and a member of the Global AI Nexus of
Schools, Hua Yi continues to integrate technology meaningfully into learning.
Our students use digital tools to collaborate and innovate, while clear
routines and expectations help them build focus, balance, and responsibility.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>A Community That Cares</strong>
</p>
<p>Behind every Hua Yian stands teachers who care, parents who believe, and
alumni who continue to support the school’s journey. Together, we form
a strong and caring community that honours our past and looks confidently
to the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Moving Forward Together</strong>
</p>
<p>As we celebrate 70 years of Hua Yi, we honour our legacy while embracing
the opportunities ahead. Our legacy reminds us where we come from. Our
voice reflects who we are. And our future will be shaped by how we continue
to care, to grow, and to lead together, with confidence and courage.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Warm regards,
<br>Dr Lim Siew Yee
<br>Principal
