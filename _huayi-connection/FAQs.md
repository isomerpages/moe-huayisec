<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h4>General Information</h4>
<p><strong>1 . What time does school start?</strong>

<p><strong>4 . How are your current students’ progression to post-secondary institutions?</strong>
<br>Our students are pursuing pathways that align with their strengths, interests,
and aspirations across the junior colleges, polytechnics, and the Institute
of Technical Education (ITE). The majority of students who offered mainly
G3 subjects are eligible for JC admission, with almost all qualifying for
polytechnic courses. Students who offered mainly G1 or G2 subjects are
eligible for progression through the ITE, Direct-Entry-Scheme to Polytechnic
Programme (DPP), Early Admissions Exercise (EAE), or Polytechnic Foundation
Programme (PFP) respectively.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>5 . How is the culture of the school?</strong>
<br>Hua Yi’s culture is one that honours our heritage while embracing the
future. Since becoming a co-educational school in 1985, we have grown into
a caring and inclusive community where English serves as the main language
of learning. Through experiences such as calligraphy lessons and cultural
programmes, students gain a deeper appreciation of their roots while developing
global perspectives and strong values that prepare them for the world ahead.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>6 . How is the discipline of the school?</strong>
<br>The school takes a very strong stand on appropriate behaviour of Hua Yians.

<p><strong>2. What is Hua Yi’s strategy for Blended Learning?</strong>
</p>
<p>Hua Yi’s approach to Blended Learning is aligned with MOE’s objectives,
providing students with opportunities to take greater ownership of their
learning, while developing self-efficacy, self-awareness, and self-management
skills. This is achieved through a thoughtful integration of student-driven
learning experiences and structured curriculum coverage.</p>
<p>Through Blended Learning, teachers leverage the strengths of both in-person
and distance learning to design lessons that are best suited to each mode
of engagement. This approach also enables teachers to create meaningful
learning experiences that may be challenging to implement within the constraints
of classroom time or large-group settings, thereby enriching students’
learning beyond the physical classroom.</p>
<p>Blended Learning at Hua Yi comprises two key components:</p>
<p><strong>I. Student-Initiated Learning: Project Sandbox</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>
<br>Project Sandbox, conducted on even-week Friday afternoons, empowers students
to take ownership of their learning through the exploration of personal
interests such as Art and Craft, Digital Literacy, Languages, Music, Sports
and Fitness, and Technology. Students initiate ideas and drive their own
learning, with teachers supporting them as mentors across learning contexts
in and beyond school.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Foster self-directed learning and encourage students to pursue their passions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills through
experiential learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultivate teacher–student partnerships that support student agency and
reflective learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>II. Curriculum Coverage on Home-Based Learning Days (HBL)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>
<br>Home-Based Learning (HBL) days are scheduled across the year to support
meaningful curriculum learning beyond the classroom. Lessons are thoughtfully
designed to enable students to learn independently, consolidate key concepts,
and apply their learning to real-life contexts through a range of self-directed,
applied, and collaborative activities. Learning takes place through a combination
of synchronous and asynchronous modes.</p>
<p>Teachers leverage digital platforms such as the Singapore Student Learning
Space (SLS) and Google Classroom to provide timely feedback and opportunities
for self-assessment. Learning experiences are differentiated to cater to
students’ readiness levels, interests, and learning preferences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In Term 3, students also experience three consecutive days of HBL
during the national oral examinations. Guided by the principles of <strong>JOY — Joy in Learning, Ownership of Learning, and Applying Learning</strong>,
students engage in integrated project work and apply their learning to
authentic, real-world problems.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3 . How will the Personal Device be implemented in Hua Yi?</strong>
</p>
<p>Every Hua Yian will be using the Apple iPad as their personal learning
device. Every iPad will come bundled with the Apple pencil and keyboard
to maximise the affordances of the iPad as a learning tool.</p>
<p>Not only is the iPad a portable device that offers students convenient
learning on-the-move, it also allows for a seamless learning experience
alongside existing learning technologies such as the Student Learning Space
(SLS) and Goodnotes Classroom. For more information on PDLP: <a href="https://www.huayisec.moe.edu.sg/the-huayi-experience/pdlp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.huayisec.moe.edu.sg/the-huayi-experience/pdlp/</a>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>4. How will Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB) look like in Hua Yi?</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2021, we have integrated the Normal Academic and Normal Technical stream.
The integration of both streams is Hua Yi’s first step towards Full Subject-Based
Banding (FSBB) in 2022 as we celebrate the unique strengths and diversity
of our students.</p>
<p>(a) How does FSBB work?</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>FSBB is fully implemented in 2024, with the removal of the different streams.
All students will be grouped into mixed form classes, with the provision
of a common curriculum.
<br>Besides the common curriculum, students have the flexibility to take SBB
subjects at G1, G2 or G3 level.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Common Curriculum comprises the following subjects:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Art;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design &amp; Technology;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food and Consumer Education (FCE);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Music;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical Education (PE)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and the SBB subjects offered comprises the following subjects:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>English Language;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mother Tongue Languages;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mathematics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Science;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Geography;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>History;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Literature in English</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>5. Does the school offer SBB?</strong>
</p>
<p>Hua Yi currently offers Subject-Based Banding (SBB) for English, Mother
Tongues, Mathematics, Science, Humanities subjects (Geography and History)
and Literature in English. Further information and details about SBB in
Hua Yi will be shared during the Secondary 1 Registration event in December.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>6. What is ALP and/ or LLP about?</strong>

<p><strong>7. What after-school engagement programmes are available in your school?</strong>
</p>
<p>Hua Yi offers a wide range of after-school engagement programmes to help
students develop critical soft-skills such as:</p>
<p><strong>a) Mentoring Program by the GRIT Academy (TGA)</strong>
</p>
<p>A 6 to 9 month mentoring programme by the youth branch of the Lakeside
Family Services. Students undergo a journey of self-discovery through experential
activities supported by mentors and friends.</p>
<p><strong>b) The Discovery Program</strong>
</p>
<p>A creative program to empower students with skills to enhance their self-awareness
and manage positive relationships with others. Students learn strategies
for self-management, coping skills and the activities help them to build
up their readiness and resilience.</p>
<p><strong>c) Youth Venture (partnership with Lakeside Family Service Centre)</strong>
</p>
<p>An 8-month adventure-themed based programme to develop and build character
and resilience.</p>
<p><strong>d) Student Support Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Programmes focus on behavioral, social emotional skills or meaningful
holiday engagement.</p>
<p>Hangout @ Hua Yi is run by our school’s learning mentor. The venue is
a vibrant space equipped with a variety of facilities and activities for
students to engage in after school. The learning mentor establishes a strong
level of rapport with students and helps inculcate in them stronger self-management
skills. There are also constant innovations for Hangout to make it ever
more attractive for students to drop in.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>8. House System</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2022, Hua Yi made a major change to the way the school was structured.
The school adopted a house system, with the school and student body organised
by their house (Altius, Citius, Diutius, Fortius, Latius) instead of level.
Taking reference from the Olympic motto, each house espouses an Olympic
ideal to inspire every student and staff to give their all in the pursuit
of excellence. Headed by a House Master, guided by a House Discipline Master,
managed by two House Managers, and led by two House Leaders from each class,
every house is a unique ecosystem by itself! This organisational move helped
to strengthen the camaraderie of students from different classes across
levels. It also created opportunities for a stronger house spirit to shine
through in each house, as many school activities and programmes leveraged
the house system to promote a spirit of friendly competition.</p>
