## Homework Policy

Our homework policy articulates the purpose of homework and how homework load is regulated, monitored and coordinated. This policy is communicated to staff, parents and students.

#### Definition of Homework

Homework is any learning activity that students are required by the school to complete outside of timetabled curriculum. Homework can take the form of projects, research, e-learning, worksheets, practice papers and presentation.

##### Purpose of Homework

Homework when used appropriately, can improve students’ knowledge, skills and disposition towards learning. Students are to turn in their homework to their subject teachers for checking of students’ progress, grading and feedback to move learning forward with appropriate intervention and support.&nbsp;

Homework enables students to:<br>
1 \.  apply knowledge and skills learnt from class<br>
2 \.  receive feedback that moves learning forward<br>
3 \.  reinforce learning<br>
4 \.  cultivate a healthy disposition towards ownership and leadership of learning (life skills and study habits)

##### Guidelines for Homework load

| **Level** | **Weekly (Hours)** | **March/September Holiday (Hours)** | **June/December Holiday (Hours)** |
|:---:|---|---|---|
| Lower Sec | 8 – 10 hours | 6 hours | 12 hours |
| Upper Sec | 10 – 12 hours | 12 hours | 24 hours |
|  |  |  |  |

##### Homework Boards

Hua Yi has processes in place to monitor and coordinate homework load with the deployment of designated homework boards in every class that lists all the homework, tests and projects assigned. This helps teachers and students to be aware of the spread of homework given to the class, so that they can coordinate and adjust the workload and assignment deadlines where appropriate. The school is cognisant of our students’ involvement on CCA Days (Wednesdays and Fridays), so homework load on these days is reduced and submission dates adjusted.
