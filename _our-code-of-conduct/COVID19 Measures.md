## COVID-19 Measures

#### What are the safe management measures put in place in schools?

With the relaxation of the national COVID-19 Safe-Management Measures, staff and students should continue to exercise social responsibility so that school continues to be a safe environment everyone.  
  
1 \.  Students and staff who are unwell with COVID-19 symptoms, are required to stay away from school. They should be tested for COVID-19 and seek medical attention if necessary. Unwell individuals should remain at home until they are tested negative for COVID-19.
  
2 \.  Students and staff who have household members who are COVID-19 positive are required to take daily ART for 5 days before coming to school.
  
3 \.  Mask-wearing is optional in both indoor and outdoor school settings.
  
4 \.  Cleaning of high-touch surfaces will be performed regularly.
  
5 \.  Students are strongly encouraged to practise frequent hand-washing throughout the school day and wipe-down tables and shared equipment after use.
