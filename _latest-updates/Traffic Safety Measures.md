## Traffic Safety Measures

Dear Parents, as the safety of our students is of utmost importance, we seek your cooperation to abide by our **“No Right Turn”** rule from Mondays to Fridays, 7:00am to 7:30am should you be driving your child to school. Please turn left at the gate towards Jurong West St 42 as you exit our school premises. This will also allow other vehicles to enter the school quickly. In addition, for the safety of our staff and students, please follow the traffic guidance given by our staff or security guards. Thank you.
