## Staff Contact Hours

Dear Parents/Guardians/Students,

Please be reminded that due to the five-day work week, the hours within which staff (teaching and non-teaching staff) can be contacted (either via video conferencing, phone calls or text messages) will be before 7pm on weekdays. Please be advised that staff may only be able to respond the next working day if they are not contactable or are unable to access their email during the day or if the queries and/or requests were made beyond the stipulated hours.

Staff are not expected to respond to parents’ and students’ queries during the weekends, though this can be considered on a case-by-case basis, depending on the urgency of the request. Thank you for your kind understanding.
